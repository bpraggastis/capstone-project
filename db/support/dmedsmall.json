        "value" : "Following IV administration of 1, 2, and 3 gram doses of Cefizox to normal volunteers, the following serum levels were obtained. A serum half\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDlife of approximately 1.7 hours was observed after IV or IM administration. Cefizox is 30% protein bound. Cefizox is not metabolized, and is excreted virtually unchanged by the kidneys in 24 hours. This provides a high urinary concentration. Concentrations greater than 6000\uFFFD\uFFFDg/mL have been achieved in the urine by 2 hours after a 1 gram dose of Cefizox intravenously. Probenecid slows tubular secretion and produces even higher serum levels, increasing the duration of measurable serum concentrations. Cefizox achieves therapeutic levels in various body fluids, e.g., cerebrospinal fluid (in patients with inflamed meninges), bile, surgical wound fluid, pleural fluid, aqueous humor, ascitic fluid, peritoneal fluid, prostatic fluid and saliva, and in the following body tissues: heart, gallbladder, bone, biliary, peritoneal, prostatic, and uterine. In clinical experience to date, no disulfiram\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDlike reactions have been reported with Cefizox.<br/>Microbiology: The bactericidal action of Ceftizoxime results from inhibition of cell\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDwall synthesis. Ceftizoxime is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDlactamases (penicillinase and cephalosporinase), including Richmond types I, II, III, TEM, and IV, produced by both aerobic and anaerobic gram\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDpositive and gram\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDnegative organisms.  Ceftizoxime  has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section:<br/>Aerobic Gram-Positive Microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase producing strains) NOTE: Methicillin\uFFFD\uFFFDresistant staphylococci are resistant to cephalosporins, including ceftizoxime. Staphylococcus epidermidis (including penicillinase producing strains) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes NOTE:  A streptococcal isolate that is susceptible to penicillin can be considered susceptible to ceftizoxime. NOTE: Ceftizoxime is usually inactive against most strains of Enterococcus faecalis.<br/>Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms: Enterobacter spp. Escherichia coli Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin\uFFFD\uFFFDresistant strains) Klebsiella pneumoniae Morganella morganii Neisseria gonorrhoeae Proteus mirabilis Proteus vulgaris Providencia rettgeri Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serratia marcescens<br/>Anaerobic Microorganisms: Bacteroides spp. Peptococcus spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90% of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ceftizoxime. However, the safety and effectiveness of ceftizoxime  in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.<br/>Aerobic Gram-Negative Microorganisms: Aeromonas hydrophila Citrobacter spp. Moraxellacatarrhalis Neisseria meningitidis Providencia stuartii<br/>Susceptibility Testing Methods::<br/>Dilution techniques:: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).  These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.  The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure.  Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of ceftizoxime powder.  The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDSusceptible\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable.  A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDIntermediate\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated.  This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used.  This category also provides a buffer zone, which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.  A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDResistant\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable, other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures.  Standard ceftizoxime powder should provide the following MIC values:<br/>Diffusion Techniques:: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedurerequires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30-\uFFFD\uFFFDg ceftizoxime to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to ceftizoxime. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30-\uFFFD\uFFFDg ceftizoxime disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques.  Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for ceftizoxime. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures.  For the diffusion technique, the 30-\uFFFD\uFFFDg ceftizoxime disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:<br/>Anaerobic Techniques:: For anaerobic bacteria, the susceptibility to ceftizoxime as MICs can be determined by standardized test methods.  Agar dilution results can vary widely when using ceftizoxime.  It is recommended that broth microdilution method be used when possible.The MIC values obtained should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Interpretation is identical to that described in Susceptibility Testing: Dilution Techniques. As with other susceptibility techniques, the use of laboratory control microorganisms is required to control the technical aspects of the laboratory standardized procedures.  Standardized ceftizoxime powder should provide the following MIC values:<br/>Susceptibility Testing for Pseu domonas in Urinary Tract Infections: Most strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are moderately susceptible to ceftizoxime. Ceftizoxime achieves high levels in the urine (greater than 6000 mcg/mL at 2 hours with 1 gram IV) and, therefore, the following zone sizes should be used when testing ceftizoxime for treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Susceptible organisms produce zones of 20 mm or greater, indicating that the test organism is likely to respond to therapy. Organisms that produce zones of 11 to 19 mm are expected to be susceptible when the infection is confined to the urinary tract (in which high antibiotic levels are attained). Resistant organisms produce zones of 10 mm or less, indicating that other therapy should be selected.",

        "value" : "Note:  Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) in the ADD-Vantage'  vial is intended for intravenous infusion only after dilution with the appropriate volume of ADD-Vantage diluent solution. The usual adult dosage is 1 or 2 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) every 8 to 12 hours. Proper dosage and route of administration should be determined by the condition of the patient, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms. Because of the serious nature of urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt. A single, 1 gram IM dose is the usual dose for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea. The IV route may be preferable for patients with bacterial septicemia, localized parenchymal abscesses (such as intra\uFFFD\uFFFDabdominal abscess), peritonitis, or other severe or life\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDthreatening infections. In those with normal renal function, the IV dosage for such infections is 2 to 12 grams of Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) daily. In conditions such as bacterial septicemia, 6 to 12 grams/day may be given initially by the IV route for several days, and the dosage may then be gradually reduced according to clinical response and laboratory findings. Dosage may be increased to a total daily dose of 200 mg/kg (not to exceed the maximum adult dose for serious infection).<br/>Impaired Renal Function: Modification of Cefizox dosage is necessary in patients with impaired renal function. Following an initial loading dose of 500 mg-1 gram IM or IV, the maintenance dosing schedule shown below should be followed. Further dosing should be determined by therapeutic monitoring, severity of the infection, and susceptibility of the causative organisms. When only the serum creatinine level is available, creatinine clearance may be calculated from the following formula. The serum creatinine level should represent current renal function at the steady state. Males Females are 0.85 of the calculated clearance values for males. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, no additional supplemental dosing is required following hemodialysis; however, dosing should be timed so that the patient receives the dose (according to the table below) at the end of the dialysis.<br/>Reconstitution: Cefizox in the ADD-Vantage vial is intended for use with ADD-Vantage diluent containers only, available in 50 mL and 100 mL sizes of Sodium Chloride Injection 0.9% and Dextrose Injection 5%. Ordinarily, the ADD-Vantage vials should be reconstituted only when it is certain that the patient is ready to receive the drug.  However, reconstitued Cefizox is stable for 24 hours at room temperature or 96 hours under refrigeration 5\uFFFD\uFFFDC (41\uFFFD\uFFFDF). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.<br/>To Open ADD-Vantage ' Diluent Containers: Peel overwrap at corner and remove solution container.  Some opacity of the plastic due to moisture absorption during the sterilization process may be observed.  This is normal and does not affect the solution quality or safety.  The opacity will diminish gradually.<br/>To Assemble Vial and Flexible Diluent Container (Use Aseptic Technique): 1. Remove the protective covers from the top of the vial and the vial port on the diluent container as follows: a.  To remove the breakaway vial cap, swing the pull ring over the top of the vial and pull down far enough to start the opening (SEE FIGURE 1.), then pull straight up to remove the cap. (SEE FIGURE 2.) NOTE:  Once the breakaway cap has been removed, do not access vial with syringe. b.  To remove the vial port cover, grasp the tab on the pull ring, pull up to break the three tie strings, then pull further to remove the cover. (SEE FIGURE 3.) 2.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae. NOTE: Ceftizoxime, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti\uFFFD\uFFFDchlamydial coverage should be added. Intra\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDAbdominal Infections caused by Escherichia coli; Staphylococcusepidermidis; Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Enterobacter spp.; Klebsiella spp.; Bacteroides spp. including  B. fragilis; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Septicemia caused by Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae (but excluding enterococci); Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDand nonpenicillinase\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDproducing); Escherichia coli; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis; Klebsiella spp.; and Serratia spp. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDand nonpenicillinase\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDproducing); Staphylococcus epidermidis; Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; Streptococcus spp. including Streptococcus pyogenes (but excluding enterococci); Proteus mirabilis; Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDand nonpenicillinase\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDproducing); Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Proteusmirabilis; Bacteroides spp.; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Cefizox has also been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic. Infections caused by aerobic gram\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDnegative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox. Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt. Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used concomitantly with aminoglycosides . Before using Cefizox concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function shouldbe carefully monitored. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.  When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.  In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.",

        "value" : "General: As with all broad\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDspectrum antibiotics, Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Although Cefizox has not been shown to produce an alteration in renal function, renal status should be evaluated, especially in seriously ill patients receiving maximum dose therapy. As with any antibiotic, prolonged use may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. Careful observation is essential; appropriate measures should be taken if superinfection occurs. Cephalosporins may be associated with a fall in prothrombin activity.  Those at risk include patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or poor nutritional state, as well as patients receiving a protracted course of antimicrobial therapy, and patients previously stabilized on anticoagulant therapy.  Prothrombin time should be monitored in patients at risk and exogenous vitamin K administered as indicated. Prescribing Cefizox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.<br/>Drug Interactions: Although the occurrence has not been reported with Cefizox, nephrotoxicity has been reported following concomitant administration of other cephalosporins and aminoglycosides.<br/>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDterm studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of ceftizoxime have not been conducted. In an in vitro bacterial cell assay (i.e., Ames test), there was no evidence of mutagenicity at ceftizoxime concentrations of 0.001\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD0.5 mcg/plate. Ceftizoxime did not produce increases in micronuclei in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test when given to animals at doses up to 7500 mg/kg, approximately six times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mg/Mbasis. Ceftizoxime had no effect on fertility when administered subcutaneously to rats at daily doses of up to 1000 mg/kg/day, approximately two times the maximum human daily dose on a mg/Mbasis. Ceftizoxime produced no histological changes in the sexual organs of male and female dogs when given intravenously for thirteen weeks at a dose of 1000 mg/kg/day, approximately five times greater than the maximum human daily dose on a mg/Mbasis.<br/>Pregnancy::<br/>Teratogenic Effects::<br/>Pregnancy Category B.: Reproduction studies performed in rats and rabbits have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Cefizox. There are, however, no adequate and well\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDcontrolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human effects, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<br/>Labor and Delivery: Safety of Cefizox use during labor and delivery has not been established.<br/>Nursing Mothers: Cefizox is excreted in human milk in low concentrations. Caution should be exercised when Cefizox is administered to a nursing woman.<br/>Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients from birth to six months of age have not been established. In pediatric patients six months of age and older, treatment with Cefizox has been associated with transient elevated levels of eosinophils, AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), and CPK (creatine phosphokinase). The CPK elevation may be related to IM administration. The potential for the toxic effect in pediatric patients from chemicals that may leach from the single\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDdose IV preparation in plastic has not been determined.<br/>Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of ceftizoxime did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.  Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients.  In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.<br/>Information for Patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Cefizox should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold).  When Cefizox is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be takenexactly as directed.  Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Cefizox or other antibacterial drugs in the future.",

SERIOUS ACUTE HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS MAY REQUIRE TREATMENT WITH EPINEPHRINE AND OTHER EMERGENCY MEASURES, INCLUDING OXYGEN, IV FLUIDS, IV ANTIHISTAMINES, CORTICOSTEROIDS, PRESSOR AMINES, AND AIRWAY MANAGEMENT, AS CLINICALLY INDICATED. Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including ceftizoxime, and may range in severity from mild to life threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon and may permit overgrowth of clostridia. Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is a primary cause of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDantibiotic\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDassociated\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDcolitis. After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, appropriate therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against Clostridium difficile colitis.",

        "value" : "Timolol is a non-selective beta-adrenergic antagonist.It blocks both beta-and beta-adrenergic receptors. Timolol does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) or direct myocardial depressant activity. Timolol, when applied topically in the eye, reduces normal and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss. The higher the level of IOP, the greater the likelihood of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. The predominant mechanism of ocular hypotensive action of topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is likely due to a reduction in aqueous humor production. In general, beta-adrenergic blocking agents reduce cardiac output both in healthy subjects and patients with heart diseases. In patients with severe impairment of myocardial function, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may inhibit sympathetic stimulatory effect necessary to maintain adequate cardiac function. In the bronchi and bronchioles, beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may also increase airway resistance because of unopposed parasympathetic activity.<br/>Pharmacokinetics: When given orally, timolol is well absorbed and undergoes considerable first pass metabolism. Timolol and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine. The half-life of timolol in plasma is approximately 4 hours.<br/>Clinical Studies: In two controlled multicenter studies in the U.S., Betimol 0.25% and 0.5% were compared with respective timolol maleate eyedrops. In these studies, the efficacy and safety profile of Betimol was similar to that of timolol maleate.",

If the intraocular pressure is maintained at satisfactory levels, the dosage schedule may be changed to one drop once a day in the affected eye(s). Because of diurnal variations in intraocular pressure, satisfactory response to the once-a-day dose is best determined by measuring the intraocular pressure at different times during the day. Since in some patients the pressure-lowering response to Betimol may require a few weeks to stabilize, evaluation should include a determination of intraocular pressure after approximately 4 weeks of treatment with Betimol. Dosages above one drop of 0.5 percent Betimol twice a day generally have not been shown to produce further reduction in intraocular pressure. If the patient's intraocular pressure is still not at a satisfactory level on this regimen, concomitant therapy with pilocarpine and other miotics, and/or epinephrine, and/or systemically administered carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as acetazolamide, can be instituted.",

        "value" : "General: Because of the potential effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents relative to blood pressure and pulse, these agents should be used with caution in patients with cerebrovascular insufficiency. If signs or symptoms suggesting reduced cerebral blood flow develop following initiation of therapy with Betimol, alternative therapy should be considered. There have been reports of bacterial keratitis associated with the use of multiple dose containers of topical ophthalmic products. These containers had been inadvertently contaminated by patients who, in most cases, had a concurrent corneal disease or a disruption of the ocular epithelial surface. Muscle Weakness: Beta-adrenergic blockade has been reported to potentiate muscle weakness consistent with certain myasthenic symptoms (e.g. diplopia, ptosis, and generalized weakness). Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been reported rarely to increase muscle weakness in some patients with myasthenia gravis or myasthenic symptoms. In angle-closure glaucoma, the goal of the treatment is to reopen the angle. This requires constricting the pupil. Betimol has no effect on the pupil. Therefore, if timolol is used in angle-closure glaucoma, it should always be combined with a miotic and not used alone. Anaphylaxis: While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of atopy or a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated accidental, diagnostic, or therapeutic challenge with such allergens. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat anaphylactic reactions. The preservative benzalkonium chloride may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses should wait 5 minutes after instilling Betimol before they insert their lenses.<br/>Information for Patients: Patients should be instructed to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or surrounding structures. Patients should also be instructed that ocular solutions can become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions. Patients requiring concomitant topical ophthalmic medications should be instructed to administer these at least 5 minutes apart. Patients with bronchial asthma, a history of bronchial asthma, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinus bradycardia, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block, or cardiac failure should be advised not to take this product<br/>Drug Interactions: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and Betimol should be observed for a potential additive effect either on the intraocular pressure or on the known systemic effects of beta-blockade. Patients should not usually receive two topical ophthalmic beta-adrenergic blocking agents concurrently. Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta-blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension. Calcium antagonists: Caution should be used in the co-administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists, because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, co-administration should be avoided. Digitalis and calcium antagonists: The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time. Injectable Epinephrine:<br/>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenicity of timolol (as the maleate) has been studied in mice and rats. In a two-year study orally administrated timolol maleate (300mg/kg/day) (approximately 42,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose) in male rats caused a significant increase in the incidence of adrenal pheochromocytomas; the lower doses, 25 mg or 100 mg/kg daily did not cause any changes. In a life span study in mice the overall incidence of neoplasms was significantly increased in female mice at 500 mg/kg/day (approximately 71,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). Furthermore, significant increases were observed in the incidences of benign and malignant pulmonary tumors, benign uterine polyps, as well as mammary adenocarcinomas. These changes were not seen at the daily dose level of 5 or 50 mg/kg (approximately 700 or 7,000, respectively, times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). For comparison, the maximum recommended human oral dose of timolol maleate is 1 mg/kg/day. Mutagenic potential of timolol was evaluated in vivo in the micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay and in vitro in the neoplastic cell transformation assay and Ames test. In the bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test) high concentrations of timolol maleate (5000 and 10,000 g/plate) statistically significantly increased the number of revertants in Salmonella typhimurium TA100, but not in the other three strains tested. However, no consistent dose-response was observed nor did the number of revertants reach the double of the control value, which is regarded as one of the criteria for a positive result in the Ames test. In vivo genotoxicity tests (the mouse micronucleus test and cytogenetic assay) and in vitro the neoplastic cell transformation assay were negative up to dose levels of 800 mg/kg and 100 g/mL, respectively. No adverse effects on male and female fertility were reported in rats at timolol oral doses of up to 150 mg/kg/day (21,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose).<br/>PREGNANCY:<br/>Teratogenic effects: Category C: Teratogenicity of timolol (as the maleate) after oral administration was studied in mice and rabbits. No fetal malformations were reported in mice or rabbits at a daily oral dose of 50 mg/kg (7,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose). Although delayed fetal ossification was observed at this dose in rats, there were no adverse effects on postnatal development of offspring. Doses of 1000 mg/kg/day (142,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose) were maternotoxic in mice and resulted in an increased number of fetal resorptions. Increased fetal resorptions were also seen in rabbits at doses of 14,000 times the systemic exposure following the maximum recommended human ophthalmic dose in this case without apparent maternotoxicity. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Betimol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.<br/>Nursing mothers: Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from timolol, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.<br/>Pediatric use: Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients have not been established.",

        "value" : "As with other topically applied ophthalmic drugs, Betimol is absorbed systemically. The same adverse reactions found with systemic administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may occur with topical administration. For example, severe respiratory and cardiac reactions, including death due to bronchospasm in patients with asthma, and rarely, death in association with cardiac failure have been reported following systemic or topical administration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents. Cardiac Failure: Sympathetic stimulation may be essential for support of the circulation in individuals with diminished myocardial contractility, and its inhibition by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade may precipitate more severe cardiac failure. In patients without a history of cardiac failure, continued depression of the myocardium with beta-blocking agents over a period of time can, in some cases, lead to cardiac failure. Betimol should be discontinued at the first sign or symptom of cardiac failure. Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (e.g. chronic bronchitis, emphysema) of mild or moderate severity, bronchospastic disease, or a history of bronchospastic disease (other than bronchial asthma or a history of bronchial asthma which are contraindications) should in general not receive beta-blocking agents. Major Surgery: The necessity or desirability of withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents prior to a major surgery is controversial. Beta-adrenergic receptor blockade impairs the ability of the heart to respond to beta-adrenergically mediated reflex stimuli. This may augment the risk of general anesthesia in surgical procedures. Some patients receiving beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents have been subject to protracted severe hypotension during anesthesia. Difficulty in restarting and maintaining the heartbeat has also been reported. For these reasons, in patients undergoing elective surgery, gradual withdrawal of beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents is recommended. If necessary during surgery, the effects of beta-adrenergic blocking agents may be reversed by sufficient doses of beta-adrenergic agonists. Diabetes Mellitus: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents should be administered with caution in patients subject to spontaneous hypoglycemia or to diabetic patients (especially those with labile diabetes) who are receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents. Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents may mask the signs and symptoms of acute hypoglycemia. Thyrotoxicosis: Beta-adrenergic blocking agents may mask certain clinical signs (e.g. tachycardia) of hyperthyroidism. Patients suspected of developing thyrotoxicosis should be managed carefully to avoid abrupt withdrawal of beta-adrenergic blocking agents which might precipitate a thyroid storm.",

        "value" : "Lactic Acidosis:: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with RIOMET; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels>5\uFFFD\uFFFDg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable oracute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking RIOMET and by use of the minimum effective dose of RIOMET. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. RIOMET treatment should not be initiated in patients\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, RIOMET should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, RIOMET should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking RIOMET, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, RIOMET should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). RIOMET should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of RIOMET, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking RIOMET do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.) Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking RIOMET, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correctthe acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery. (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS.)",

        "value" : "Mechanism of Action: Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Its pharmacologic mechanisms of action are different from other classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.<br/>Pharmacokinetics:<br/>Absorption and Bioavailability: Two pharmacokinetic studies have been performed in healthy volunteers to evaluate the bioavailability of RIOMET in comparison with the commercially available metformin tablets under fasting and fed conditions (study 1 and study 2). A third pharmacokinetic study (study 3) assessed effects of food on absorption of RIOMET . The rate and extent of absorption of RIOMET was found to be comparable to that of Metformin tablets under fasting or fed conditions (see Table 1). The food-effect study (study 3) assessed the effects of a high fat/high calorie meal and a low fat/low calorie meal on the bioavailability of RIOMET in comparison with administration in the fasted state, in healthy volunteers. The extent of absorption was increased by 21% and 17% with the low fat/low calorie meal and the high fat/high calorie meal, respectively, compared with the administration in the fasted state. The rate and extent of absorption with high fat/high calorie and low fat/low calorie meal were similar. The mean twas 2.5 hours under fasting conditions as compared to 3.9 hours with both low fat/ low calorie meal and high fat/high calorie meals (see Table 2). Studies using single oral doses of metformin tablet formulations 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination.<br/>Distribution: The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of a 850 mg tablet averaged 654\uFFFD\uFFFD358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin, steady state plasma concentrations are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally<1\uFFFD\uFFFDg/mL. During controlled clinical trials of metformin, maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5\uFFFD\uFFFDg/mL, even at maximum doses.<br/>Metabolism and Elimination: Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Renal clearance (see Table 3) is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.<br/>Special Populations:",

        "value" : "There is no fixed dosage regimen for the management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes with RIOMET or any other pharmacologic agent. Dosage of RIOMET must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, while not exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose. The maximum recommended daily dose of RIOMET is 2550 mg (25.5 mL) in adults and 2000 mg (20 mL) in pediatric patients (10-16 years of age). RIOMET should be given in divided doses with meals. RIOMET should be started at a low dose, with gradual dose escalation, both to reduce gastrointestinal side effects and to permit identification of the minimum dose required for adequate glycemic control of the patient. During treatment initiation and dose titration(see Recommended Dosing Schedule), fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine the therapeutic response to RIOMET and identify the minimum effective dose for the patient. Thereafter, glycosylated hemoglobin should be measured at intervals of approximately three months. The therapeutic goal should be to decrease both fasting plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels to normal or near normal by using the lowest effective dose of RIOMET, either when used as monotherapy or in combination with sulfonylurea or insulin. Monitoring of blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin will also permit detection of primary failure, i.e., inadequate lowering of blood glucose at the maximum recommended dose of medication, and secondary failure, i.e., loss of an adequate blood glucose lowering response after an initial period of effectiveness. Short-term administration of RIOMET may be sufficient during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone.<br/>Recommended Dosing Schedule:<br/>Adults: In general, clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg (15 mL) per day. However, a lower recommended starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised to minimize gastrointestinal symptoms. The usual starting dose of RIOMET (metformin hydrochloride oral solution) is 500 mg (5 mL) twice a day or 850 mg (8.5 mL) once a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg (5 mL) weekly or 850 mg (8.5 mL) every 2 weeks, up to a total of 2000 mg (20 mL) per day, given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg (5 mL) twice a day to 850 mg (8.5 mL) twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, RIOMET may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg(25.5 mL) per day. Doses above 2000 mg (20 mL) may be better tolerated given three times a day with meals.<br/>Pediatrics: The usual starting dose of RIOMET is 500 mg (5 mL) twice a day, given with meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg (5 mL) weekly up to a maximum of 2000 mg (20 mL) per day, given in divided doses.<br/>Transfer From Other Antidiabetic Therapy: When transferring patients from standard oral hypoglycemic agents other than chlorpropamide to RIOMET, no transition period generally is necessary. When transferring patients from chlorpropamide, care should be exercised during the first two weeks because of the prolonged retention of chlorpropamide in the body, leading to overlapping drug effects and possible hypoglycemia.<br/>Concomitant Metformin and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy in Adult Patients: If patients have not responded to four weeks of the maximum dose of RIOMET monotherapy, consideration should be given to gradual addition of an oral sulfonylurea while continuing RIOMET at the maximum dose, even if prior primary or secondary failure to a sulfonylurea has occurred. Clinical and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction data are currently available only for metformin plus glyburide (glibenclamide). With concomitant Metformin and sulfonylurea therapy, the desired control of blood glucose may be obtained by adjusting the dose of each drug. In a clinical trial of patients with type 2 diabetes and prior failure on glyburide, patients started on metformin 500 mg and glyburide 20 mg were titrated to 1000 mg/20 mg, 1500 mg/20 mg, 2000 mg/20 mg or 2500 mg/20 mg of metformin and glyburide, respectively, to reach the goal of glycemic control as measured by FPG, HbAand plasma glucose response (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Clinical Studies). However, attempts should be made to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug to achieve this goal. With concomitant RIOMET and sulfonylurea therapy, the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea therapy continues and may be increased. Appropriate precautions should be taken. (See Package Insert of the respective sulfonylurea.) If patients have not satisfactorily responded to one to three months of concomitant therapy with the maximum dose of RIOMET and the maximum dose of an oral sulfonylurea, consider therapeutic alternatives including switching to insulin with or without RIOMET.<br/>Concomitant Metformin and Insulin Therapy in Adult Patients: The current Insulin dose should be continued upon initiation of RIOMET therapy. RIOMET therapy should be initiated at 500 mg (5 mL) once daily in patients on insulin therapy. For patients not responding adequately, the dose of RIOMET should be increased by 500 mg (5 mL) after approximately 1 week and by 500 mg (5 mL) every week thereafter until adequate glycemic control is achieved. The maximum recommended daily dose for RIOMET is 2500 mg (25 mL). It is recommended that the insulin dose be decreased by 10% to 25% when fasting plasma glucose concentrations decrease to less than 120 mg/dL in patients receiving concomitant insulin and RIOMET. Further adjustment should be individualized based on glucose-lowering response.<br/>Specific Patient Populations: RIOMET is not recommended for use in pregnancy. RIOMET is not recommended in patients below the age of 10 years. The initial and maintenance dosing of RIOMET should be conservative in patients with advanced age, due to the potential for decreased renal function in this population. Any dosage adjustment should be based on a careful assessment of renal function. Generally, elderly, debilitated, and malnourished patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of RIOMET. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to aid in prevention of lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. (see WARNINGS.)",

        "value" : "Macrovascular Outcome: There have been no clinical studies establishing conclusive evidence of macrovascular risk reduction with Riomet or any other anti-diabetic drug.<br/>Monitoring of renal function: Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of impairment of renal function. Thus, patients with serum creatinine levels above the upper limit of normal for their age should not receive RIOMET. In patients with advanced age, RIOMET should be carefully titrated to establish the minimum dose for adequate glycemic effect, because aging is associated with reduced renal function. In elderly patients, particularly those\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD80 years of age, renal function should be monitored regularly and, generally, RIOMET should not be titrated to the maximum dose (see WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Before initiation of RIOMET therapy and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed and verified as normal. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, renal function should be assessed more frequently and RIOMET discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present.<br/>Information for Patients: Patients should be informed of the potential risks and benefits of RIOMET and of alternative modes of therapy. They should also be informed about the importance of adherence to dietary instructions, of a regular exercise program, and of regular testing of blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, renal function, and hematologic parameters. The risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development, as noted in the WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS sections, should be explained to patients. Patients should be advised to discontinue RIOMET immediately and to promptly notify their health practitioner if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgia, malaise, unusual somnolence, or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of RIOMET, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of metformin therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Patients should be counselled against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, while receiving RIOMET. Metformin alone does not usually cause hypoglycemia, although it may occur when metformin is used in conjunction with oral sulfonylureas and insulin. When initiating combination therapy, the risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment, and conditions that predispose to its development should be explained to patients and responsible family members.<br/>Laboratory Tests: Response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic measurements of fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels toward the normal range. During initial dose titration, fasting glucose can be used to determine the therapeutic response. Thereafter, both glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin should be monitored. Measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin may be especially useful for evaluating long-term control (see also DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Initial and periodic monitoring of hematologic parameters (e.g., hemoglobin/hematocrit and red blood cell indices) and renal function (serum creatinine) should be performed, at least on an annual basis. While megaloblastic anemia has rarely been seen with metformin therapy, if this is suspected, Vitamin Bdeficiency should be excluded.<br/>Drug Interactions (clinical evaluation of drug interactions done with metformin):<br/>Glyburide: In a single-dose interaction study in type 2 diabetes patients, co-administration of metformin and glyburide did not result in any changes in either metformin pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. Decreases in glyburide AUC and Cwere observed, but were highly variable. The single-dose nature of this study and the lack of correlation between glyburide blood levels and pharmacodynamic effects, makes the clinical significance of this interaction uncertain (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Concomitant Metformin and Oral Sulfonylurea Therapy).<br/>Furosemide: A single-dose, metformin-furosemide drug interaction study in healthy subjects demonstrated that pharmacokinetic parameters of both compounds were affected by co-administration. Furosemide increased the metformin plasma and blood Cby 22% and blood AUC by 15%, without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. When administered with metformin, the Cand AUC of furosemide were 31% and 12% smaller, respectively, than when administered alone, and the terminal half-life was decreased by 32%, without any significant change in furosemide renal clearance. No information is available about the interaction of metformin and furosemide when co-administered chronically.<br/>Nifedipine: A single-dose, metformin-nifedipine drug interaction study in normal healthy volunteers demonstrated that co-administration of nifedipine increased plasma metformin Cand AUC by 20% and 9%, respectively, and increased the amount excreted in the urine. Tand half-life were unaffected. Nifedipine appears to enhance the absorption of metformin. Metformin had minimal effects on nifedipine.<br/>Cationic drugs: Cationic drugs (e.g., amiloride, digoxin, morphine, procainamide, quinidine, quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin) that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. Such interaction between metformin and oral cimetidine has been observed in normal healthy volunteers in both single- and multiple-dose, metformin-cimetidine drug interaction studies, with a 60% increase in peak metformin plasma and whole blood concentrations and a 40% increase in plasma and whole blood metformin AUC. There was no change in elimination half-life in the single-dose study. Metformin had no effect on cimetidine pharmacokinetics. Although such interactions remain theoretical (except for cimetidine), careful patient monitoring and dose adjustment of RIOMET and/or the interfering drug is recommended in patients who are taking cationic medications that are excreted via the proximal renal tubular secretory system.<br/>Other: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. These drugs include the thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, andisoniazid. When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving RIOMET, the patient should be closely observed for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving RIOMET, the patient should be observed closely for hypoglycemia. In healthy volunteers, the pharmacokinetics of metformin and propranolol, and metformin and ibuprofen were not affected when co-administered in single-dose interaction studies. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins and is, therefore, less likely to interact with highly protein-bound drugs such as salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, and probenecid, as compared to the sulfonylureas, which are extensively bound to serum proteins.<br/>Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks), at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately 4X the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. However, there was an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. Results in Ames test, gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes), and in vivo mouse micronucleus tests were negative. Fertility of male and female rats was not affected by metformin when administered at doses of 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3X the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons.<br/>Pregnancy:<br/>Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category B: Recent information strongly suggests that abnormal blood glucose levels during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most experts recommend that insulin be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, RIOMET should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with metformin. Metformin was not teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, which is 2X and 6X the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparison for rats and rabbits, respectively. However, because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of humanresponse, RIOMET should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. Determination of fetal concentrations demonstrated a partial placental barrier to metformin.<br/>Nursing Mothers: Studies in lactating rats show that metformin is excreted into milk and reaches levels comparable to those in plasma. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from metformin, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. If RIOMET is discontinued, and if diet alone is inadequate for controlling blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered.<br/>Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have been established in pediatric patients ages 10 to 16 years (studies have not been conducted in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years). Use of metformin in this age group is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of metformin in adults withadditional data from a controlled clinical study in pediatric patients ages 10-16 years with type 2 diabetes, which demonstrated a similar response in glycemic control to that seen in adults. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pediatric Clinical Studies.) In this study, adverse effects were similar to those described in adults. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS: Pediatric Patients.) A maximum daily dose of 2000 mg is recommended. (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Recommended Dosing Schedule: Pediatrics.)<br/>Geriatric Use: Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. Metformin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and because the risk of serious adverse reactions to the drug is greater in patients with impaired renal function, RIOMET should only be used in patients with normal renal function (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics). Because aging is associated with reduced renal function, RIOMET should be used with caution as age increases. Care should be taken in dose selection and should be based on careful and regular monitoring of renal function. Generally, elderly patients should not be titrated to the maximum dose of RIOMET (see also WARNINGS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",

        "value" : "Lactic Acidosis:: Lactic acidosis is a rare, but serious, metabolic complication that can occur due to metformin accumulation during treatment with RIOMET; when it occurs, it is fatal in approximately 50% of cases. Lactic acidosis may also occur in association with a number of pathophysiologic conditions, including diabetes mellitus, and whenever there is significant tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxemia. Lactic acidosis is characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/L), decreased blood pH, electrolyte disturbances with an increased anion gap, and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio. When metformin is implicated as the cause of lactic acidosis, metformin plasma levels>5\uFFFD\uFFFDg/mL are generally found. The reported incidence of lactic acidosis in patients receiving metformin hydrochloride is very low (approximately 0.03 cases/1000 patient-years, with approximately 0.015 fatal cases/1000 patient-years). In more than 20,000 patient-years exposure to metformin in clinical trials, there were no reports of lactic acidosis. Reported cases have occurred primarily in diabetic patients with significant renal insufficiency, including both intrinsic renal disease and renal hypoperfusion, often in the setting of multiple concomitant medical/surgical problems and multiple concomitant medications. Patients with congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic management, in particular those with unstable oracute congestive heart failure who are at risk of hypoperfusion and hypoxemia, are at increased risk of lactic acidosis. The risk of lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal dysfunction and the patient's age. The risk of lactic acidosis may, therefore, be significantly decreased by regular monitoring of renal function in patients taking RIOMET and by use of the minimum effective dose of RIOMET. In particular, treatment of the elderly should be accompanied by careful monitoring of renal function. RIOMET treatment should not be initiated in patients\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD80 years of age unless measurement of creatinine clearance demonstrates that renal function is not reduced, as these patients are more susceptible to developing lactic acidosis. In addition, RIOMET should be promptly withheld in the presence of any condition associated with hypoxemia, dehydration, or sepsis. Because impaired hepatic function may significantly limit the ability to clear lactate, RIOMET should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. Patients should be cautioned against excessive alcohol intake, either acute or chronic, when taking RIOMET, since alcohol potentiates the effects of metformin hydrochloride on lactate metabolism. In addition, RIOMET should be temporarily discontinued prior to any intravascular radiocontrast study and for any surgical procedure (see also PRECAUTIONS). The onset of lactic acidosis often is subtle, and accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, increasing somnolence, and nonspecific abdominal distress. There may be associated hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias with more marked acidosis. The patient and the patient's physician must be aware of the possible importance of such symptoms and the patient should be instructed to notify the physician immediately if they occur (see also PRECAUTIONS). RIOMET should be withdrawn until the situation is clarified. Serum electrolytes, ketones, blood glucose and, if indicated, blood pH, lactate levels, and even blood metformin levels may be useful. Once a patient is stabilized on any dose level of RIOMET, gastrointestinal symptoms, which are common during initiation of therapy, are unlikely to be drug related. Later occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms could be due to lactic acidosis or other serious disease. Levels of fasting venous plasma lactate above the upper limit of normal but less than 5 mmol/L in patients taking RIOMET do not necessarily indicate impending lactic acidosis and may be explainable by other mechanisms, such as poorly controlled diabetes or obesity, vigorous physical activity, or technical problems in sample handling. (See also PRECAUTIONS.) Lactic acidosis should be suspected in any diabetic patient with metabolic acidosis lacking evidence of ketoacidosis (ketonuria and ketonemia). Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency that must be treated in a hospital setting. In a patient with lactic acidosis who is taking RIOMET, the drug should be discontinued immediately and general supportive measures promptly instituted. Because metformin hydrochloride is dialyzable (with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions), prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correctthe acidosis and remove the accumulated metformin. Such management often results in prompt reversal of symptoms and recovery. (See also CONTRAINDICATIONS and PRECAUTIONS.)",

In parentheses, the same table shows the frequencies with which these adverse events were associated with the discontinuation of treatment. Overall, 8% of the patients who received 30 mg, 60 mg, 120 mg, or 240 mg of ISMN in the three placebo-controlled North American studies discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Most of these discontinued because of headache. Dizziness was rarely associated with withdrawal from these studies. Since headache appears to be a dose-related adverse effect and tends to disappear with continued treatment, it is recommended that ISMN extended-release tablet treatment be initiated at low doses for several days before being increased to desired levels. In addition, the three North American trials were pooled with 11 controlled trials conducted in  Europe.

        "value" : "Mechanism of Action: ISMN extended-release tablets are an oral extended-release formulation of ISMN, the major active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate; most of the clinical activity of the dinitrate is attributable to the mononitrate. The principal pharmacological action of ISMN and all organic nitrates in general is relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, producing dilatation of peripheral arteries and veins, especially the latter. Dilatation of the veins promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the heart, thereby reducing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (preload). Arteriolar relaxation reduces systemic vascular resistance, and systolic arterial pressure and mean arterial pressure (afterload). Dilatation of the coronary arteries also occurs. The relative importance of preload reduction, afterload reduction, and coronary dilatation remains undefined.<br/>Pharmacodynamics: Dosing regimens for most chronically used drugs are designed to provide plasma concentrations that are continuously greater than a minimally effective concentration. This strategy is inappropriate for organic nitrates. Several well-controlled clinical trials have used exercise testing to assess the antianginal efficacy of continuously delivered nitrates. In the large majority of these trials, active agents were indistinguishable from placebo after 24 hours (or less) of continuous therapy. Attempts to overcome tolerance by dose escalation, even to doses far in excess of those used acutely, have consistently failed. Only after nitrates have been absent from the body for several hours has their antianginal efficacy been restored. ISMN extended-release tablets during long-term use over 42 days dosed at 120 mg once daily continued to improve exercise performance at 4 hours and at 12 hours after dosing, but its effects (although better than placebo) are less than or, at best, equal to the effects of the first dose of 60 mg.<br/>Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism: After oral administration of ISMN as a solution or immediate-release tablets, maximum plasma concentrations of ISMN are achieved in 30 to 60 minutes, with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 100%. After intravenous administration, ISMN is distributed into total body water in about 9 minutes with a volume of distribution of approximately 0.6 to 0.7 L/kg. ISMN is approximately 5% bound to human plasma proteins and is distributed into blood cells and saliva. ISMN is primarily metabolized by the liver, but unlike oral ISDN, it is not subject to first-pass metabolism. ISMN is cleared by denitration to isosorbide and glucuronidation as the mononitrate, with 96% of the administered dose excreted in the urine within 5 days and only about 1% eliminated in the feces. At least six different compounds have been detected in urine, with about 2% of the dose excreted as the unchanged drug and at least five metabolites. The metabolites are not pharmacologically active. Renal clearance accounts for only about 4% of total body clearance. The mean plasma elimination half-life of ISMN is approximately 5 hours. The disposition of ISMN in patients with various degrees of renal insufficiency, liver cirrhosis, or cardiac dysfunction was evaluated and found to be similar to that observed in healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of ISMN was not prolonged, and there was no drug accumulation in patients with chronic renal failure after multiple oral dosing. The pharmacokinetics and/or bioavailability of ISMN extended-release tablets have been studied in both normal volunteers and patients following single- and multiple-dose administration. Data from these studies suggest that the pharmacokinetics of ISMN administered as ISMN extended-release tablets are similar between normal healthy volunteers and patients with angina pectoris. In single- and multiple-dose studies, the pharmacokinetics of ISMN were dose proportional between 30 mg and 240 mg. In a multiple-dose study, the effect of age on the pharmacokinetic profile of ISMN 60 mg and 120 mg (2 x 60 mg) extended-release tablets was evaluated in subjects\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD45 years. The results of that study indicate that there are no significant differences in any of the pharmacokinetic variables of ISMN between elderly (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD65 years) and younger individuals (45 to 64 years) for the ISMN extended-release 60 mg dose. The administration of ISMN extended-release tablets 120 mg (2 x 60 mg tablets every 24 hours for 7 days) produced a dose-proportional increase in Cand AUC, without changes in Tor the terminal half-life. The older group (65 to 74 years) showed 30% lower apparent oral clearance (C1/F) following the higher dose, i.e., 120 mg, compared to the younger group (45 to 64 years); C1/F was not different between the two groups following the 60 mg regimen. While C1/F was independent of dose in the younger group, the older group showed slightly lower C1/F following the 120 mg regimen compared to the 60 mg regimen. Differences between the two age groups, however, were not statistically significant. In the same study, females showed a slight (15%) reduction in clearance when the dose was increased. Females showed higher AUCs and Ccompared to males, but these differences were accounted for by differences in body weight between the two groups. When the data were analyzed using age as a variable, the results indicated that there were no significant differences in any of the pharmacokinetic variables of ISMN between older (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD65 years) and younger individuals (45 to 64 years). The results of this study, however, should be viewed with caution due to the small numbers of subjects in each age subgroup and consequently the lack of sufficient statistical power. The following table summarizes key pharmacokinetic parameters of ISMN after single- and multiple-dose administration of ISMN as an oral solution or ISMN extended-release tablets:<br/>Food Effects: The influence of food on the bioavailability of ISMN after single-dose administration of ISMN extended-release tablet 60 mg was evaluated in three different studies involving either a \"light\" breakfast or a high-calorie, high-fat breakfast. Results of these studies indicate that concomitant food intake may decrease the rate (increase in T) but not the extent (AUC) of absorption of ISMN.<br/>CLINICAL TRIALS: Controlled trials with ISMN extended-release tablets have demonstrated antianginal activity following acute and chronic dosing. Administration of ISMN extended-release tablets once daily, taken early in the morning on arising, provided at least 12 hours of antianginal activity. In a placebo control parallel study, 30, 60, 120, and 240 mg of ISMN extended-release tablets were administered once daily for up to 6 weeks. Prior to randomization, all patients completed a 1- to 3-week single-blind placebo phase to demonstrate nitrate responsiveness and total exercise treadmill time reproducibility. Exercise tolerance tests using the Bruce Protocol were conducted prior to and at 4 and 12 hours after the morning dose on days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 42 of the double-blind period. ISMN extended-release tablets 30 and 60 mg (only doses evaluated acutely) demonstrated a significant increase from baseline in total treadmill time relative to placebo at 4 and 12 hours after the administration of the first dose. At day 42, the 120 and 240 mg dose of ISMN extended-release tablets demonstrated a significant increase in total treadmill time at 4 and 12 hours post dosing, but by day 42 the 30 and 60 mg doses no longer were differentiable from placebo. Throughout chronic dosing rebound was not observed in any ISMN extended-release tablet treatment group. Pooled data from two other trials, comparing ISMN extended-release tablets 60 mg once daily, ISDN 30 mg QID, and placebo QID in patients with chronic stable angina using a randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover design found statistically significant increases in exercise tolerance times for ISMN extended-release tablets compared to placebo at hours 4, 8, and 12 and to ISDN at hour 4. The increases in exercise tolerance on day 14, although statistically significant compared to placebo, were about half of that seen on day 1 of the trial.",

        "value" : "Endogenous androgens are responsible for normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; development of male hair distribution, such as beard, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening,and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Drugs in this class also cause retention of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorous, and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. Androgens have been reported to increase protein anabolism and decrease protein catabolism. Nitrogen balance is improved only when there is sufficient intake of calories and protein. Androgens are responsible for the growth spurt of adolescence and for eventual termination of linear growth, brought about by fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers. In children, exogenous androgens accelerate linear growth rates, but may cause disproportionate advancement in bone maturation. Use over long periods may result in fusion of the epiphyseal growth centers and termination of the growth process. Androgens have been reported to stimulate production of red blood cells by enhancing production of erythropoietic stimulation factor. During exogenous administration of androgens, endogenous testosterone release is inhibited through feedback inhibition of pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH). At large doses of exogenous androgens, spermatogenesis may also be suppressed through feedback inhibition of pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). There is a lack of substantial evidence that androgens are effective in fractures, surgery, convalescence, and functional uterine bleeding.<br/>Pharmacokinetics: Testosterone esters are less polar than free testosterone. Testosterone esters in oil injected intramuscularly are absorbed slowly from the lipid phase; thus, testosterone cypionate can be given at intervals of two to four weeks. Testosterone in plasma is 98 percent bound to a specific testosterone-estradiol binding globulin, and about 2 percent is free. Generally, the amount of this sex-hormone binding globulin in the plasma will determine the distribution of testosterone between free and bound forms, and the free testosterone concentration will determine its half-life. About 90 percent of a dose of testosterone is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid conjugates of testosterone and its metabolites; about 6 percent of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver. Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The half-life of testosterone cypionate when injected intramuscularly is approximately eight days. In many tissues the activity of testosterone appears to depend on reduction to dihydrotestosterone, which binds to cytosol receptor proteins. The steroid-receptor complex is transported to the nucleus where it initiates transcription events and cellular changes related to androgen action.",

Various dosage regimens have been used to induce pubertal changes in hypogonadal males; some experts have advocated lower dosages initially, gradually increasing the dose as puberty progresses, with or without a decrease to maintenance levels. Other experts emphasize that higher dosages are needed to induce pubertal changes and lower dosages can be used for maintenance after puberty. The chronological and skeletal ages must be taken into consideration, both in determining the initial dose and in adjusting the dose. For replacement in the hypogonadal male, 50 to 400 mg should be administered every two to four weeks.

Testosterone cypionate should not be used interchangeably with testosterone propionate because of differences in duration of action. Testosterone cypionate is not for intravenous use.<br/>Information for patients:: Patients should be instructed to report any of the following: nausea, vomiting, changes in skin color, ankle swelling, too frequent or persistent erections of the penis.<br/>Laboratory tests:: Hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (to detect polycythemia) should be checked periodically in patients receiving long-term androgen administration. Serum cholesterol may increase during androgen therapy.<br/>Drug interactions:: Androgens may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant may require reduction in order to maintain satisfactory therapeutic hypoprothrombinemia. Concurrent administration of oxyphenbutazone and androgens may result in elevated serum levels of oxyphenbutazone. In diabetic patients, the metabolic effects of androgens may decrease blood glucose and, therefore, insulin requirements.<br/>Drug/Laboratory test interferences:: Androgens may decrease levels of thyroxine-binding globulin, resulting in decreased total Tserum levels and increased resin uptake of Tand T. Free thyroid hormone levels remain unchanged, however, and there is no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction.<br/>Carcinogenesis::<br/>Animal data.: Testosterone has been tested by subcutaneous injection and implantation in mice and rats. The implant induced cervical-uterine tumors in mice, which metastasized in some cases. There is suggestive evidence that injection of testosterone into some strains of female mice increases their susceptibility to hepatoma. Testosterone is also known to increase the number of tumors and decrease the degree of differentiation of chemically-induced carcinomas of the liver in rats.<br/>Human data.: There are rare reports of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients receiving long-term therapy with androgens in high doses. Withdrawal of the drugs did not lead to regression of the tumors in all cases. Geriatric patients treated with androgens may be at an increased risk of developing prostatic hypertrophy and prostatic carcinoma although conclusive evidence to support this concept is lacking.<br/>Pregnancy::<br/>Teratogenic Effects.: Pregnancy Category X.<br/>Nursing mothers:: Testosterone cypionate is not recommended for use in nursing mothers.<br/>Pediatric use:: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 years have not been established.",

        "value" : "Pharmacokinetics: The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after oral administration have been evaluated in healthy volunteers and in immunocompromised patients with herpes simplex or varicella-zoster virus infection. Acyclovir pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized in Table 1. *Bioavailability decreases with increasing\ndose. In one multiple-dose, crossover study in healthy subjects (n = 23), it was shown that increases in plasma acyclovir concentrations were less than dose proportional with increasing dose, as shown in Table 2. The decrease in bioavailability is a function of the dose and not the dosage form. There was no effect of food on the absorption of acyclovir (n = 6); therefore, acyclovir capsules may be administered with or without food. The only known urinary metabolite is 9-[(carboxymethoxy)methyl]guanine.<br/>Special Populations:<br/>Adults with Impaired Renal Function: The half-life\nand total body clearance of acyclovir are dependent on renal function. A dosage\nadjustment is recommended for patients with reduced renal function (see DOSAGE\nAND ADMINISTRATION).<br/>Geriatrics: Acyclovir plasma\nconcentrations are higher in geriatric patients compared to younger adults,\nin part due to age-related changes in renal function. Dosage reduction may\nbe required in geriatric patients with underlying renal impairment (see PRECAUTIONS:\nGeriatric Use).<br/>Pediatrics: In general, the\npharmacokinetics of acyclovir in pediatric patients is similar to that of\nadults. Mean half-life after oral doses of 300 mg/mand 600 mg/min\npediatric patients aged 7 months to 7 years was 2.6 hours (range\n1.59 to 3.74 hours).<br/>Drug Interactions: Coadministration of probenecid with intravenous acyclovir\nhas been shown to increase the mean acyclovir half-life and the area under\nthe concentration-time curve. Urinary excretion and renal clearance were correspondingly\nreduced.<br/>Clinical Trials:<br/>Initial Genital Herpes: Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated that orally administered acyclovir significantly reduced the duration of acute infection and duration of lesion healing. The duration of pain and new lesion formation was decreased in some patient groups.<br/>Recurrent Genital Herpes: Double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in patients with frequent recurrences (6 or more episodes per year) have shown that orally administered acyclovir given daily for 4 months to 10 years prevented or reduced the frequency and/or severity of recurrences in greater than 95% of patients. In a study of patients who received acyclovir 400 mg twice daily for 3 years, 45%, 52%, and 63% of patients remained free of recurrences in the first, second, and third years, respectively. Serial analyses of the 3-month recurrence rates for the patients showed that 71% to 87% were recurrence free in each quarter.<br/>Herpes Zoster Infections: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of immunocompetent patients with localized cutaneous zoster infection, acyclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 10 days) shortened the times to lesion scabbing, healing, and complete cessation of pain, and reduced the duration of viral shedding and the duration of new lesion formation. In a similar double-blind, placebo-controlled study, acyclovir (800 mg 5 times daily for 7 days) shortened the times to complete lesion scabbing, healing, and cessation of pain; reduced the duration of new lesion formation; and reduced the prevalence of localized zoster-associated neurologic symptoms (paresthesia, dysesthesia, or hyperesthesia). Treatment was begun within 72 hours of rash onset and was most effective if started within the first 48 hours. Adults greater than 50 years of age showed greater benefit.<br/>Chickenpox: Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted in 993 pediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years with chickenpox. All patients were treated within 24 hours after the onset of rash. In 2 trials, acyclovir was administered at 20 mg/kg 4 times daily (up to 3,200 mg per day) for 5 days. In the third trial, doses of 10, 15, or 20 mg/kg were administered 4 times daily for 5 to 7 days. Treatment with acyclovir shortened the time to 50% healing; reduced the maximum number of lesions; reduced the median number of vesicles; decreased the median number of residual lesions on day 28; and decreased the proportion of patients with fever, anorexia, and lethargy by day 2. Treatment with acyclovir did not affect varicella-zoster virus-specific humoral or cellular immune responses at 1 month or 1 year following treatment.",

Because genital herpes is a sexually\ntransmitted disease, patients should avoid contact with lesions or intercourse\nwhen lesions and/or symptoms are present to avoid infecting partners. Genital\nherpes can also be transmitted in the absence of symptoms through asymptomatic\nviral shedding. If medical management of a genital herpes recurrence is indicated,\npatients should be advised to initiate therapy at the first sign or symptom\nof an episode.<br/>Chickenpox: Chickenpox in otherwise healthy children is usually a self-limited\ndisease of mild to moderate severity. Adolescents and adults tend to have\nmore severe disease. Treatment was initiated within 24 hours of the typical\nchickenpox rash in the controlled studies, and there is no information regarding\nthe effects of treatment begun later in thedisease course.<br/>Drug Interactions: See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics.<br/>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: The data presented below include references to peak steady-state\nplasma acyclovir concentrations observed in humans treated with 800 mg\ngiven orally 5 times a day (dosing appropriate for treatment of herpes\nzoster) or 200 mg given orally 5 times a day (dosing appropriate\nfor treatment of genital herpes). Plasma drug concentrations in animal studies\nare expressed as multiples of human exposure to acyclovir at the higher and\nlower dosing schedules (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacokinetics). Acyclovir\nwas tested in lifetime bioassays in rats and mice at single daily doses of\nup to 450 mg/kg administered by gavage. There was no statistically significant\ndifference in the incidence of tumors between treated and control animals,\nnor did acyclovir shorten the latency of tumors. Maximum plasma concentrations\nwere 3 to 6 times human levels in the mouse bioassay and 1 to 2 times\nhuman levels in the rat bioassay. Acyclovir was tested\nin 16 in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity assays. Acyclovir was positive\nin 5 of the assays. Acyclovir did not impair fertility\nor reproduction in mice (450 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or in rats (25 mg/kg/day,\ns.c.). In the mouse study, plasma levels were 9 to 18 times human levels,\nwhile in the rat study, they were 8 to 15 times human levels. At higher\ndoses (50 mg/kg/day, s.c.) in rats and rabbits (11 to 22 and 16 to 31 times\nhuman levels, respectively) implantation efficacy, but not litter size, was\ndecreased. In a rat peri- and post-natal study at 50 mg/kg/day, s.c.,\nthere was a statistically significant decrease in group mean numbers of corpora\nlutea, total implantation sites, and livefetuses. No\ntesticular abnormalities were seen in dogs given 50 mg/kg/day, IV for\n1 month (21 to 41 times human levels) or in dogs given 60 mg/kg/day\norally for 1 year (6 to 12 times human levels). Testicular atrophy\nand aspermatogenesis were observed in rats and dogs at higher dose levels.<br/>Pregnancy:<br/>Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category\nB. Acyclovir administered during organogenesis was not teratogenic in the\nmouse (450 mg/kg/day, p.o.), rabbit (50 mg/kg/day, s.c. and IV),\nor rat (50 mg/kg/day, s.c.). These exposures resulted in plasma levels\n9 and 18, 16 and 106, and 11 and 22 times, respectively, human levels. There are no adequate and\nwell-controlled studies in pregnant women. A prospective epidemiologic registry\nof acyclovir use during pregnancy was established in 1984 and completed in\nApril 1999. There were 749 pregnancies followed in women exposed to systemic\nacyclovir during the first trimester of pregnancy resulting in 756 outcomes.\nThe occurrence rate of birth defects approximates that found in the general\npopulation. However, the small size of the registry is insufficient to evaluate\nthe risk for less common defects or to permit reliable or definitive conclusions\nregarding the safety of acyclovir in pregnant women and their developing fetuses.\nAcyclovir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies\nthe potential risk to the fetus.<br/>Nursing Mothers: Acyclovir concentrations have been documented in breast milk in 2 women following oral administration of acyclovir and ranged from 0.6 to 4.1 times corresponding plasma levels. These concentrations would potentially expose the nursing infant to a dose of acyclovir up to 0.3 mg/kg/day. Acyclovir should be administered to a nursing mother with caution and only when indicated.<br/>Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of oral formulations of acyclovir\nin pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age have not been established.<br/>Geriatric Use: Of 376 subjects who received acyclovir in a clinical study\nof herpes zoster treatment in immunocompetent subjects\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD50 years\nof age, 244 were 65 and over while 111 were 75 and over. No overall differences\nin effectiveness for time to cessation of new lesion formation or time to\nhealing were reported between geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects.\nThe duration of pain after healing was longer in patients 65 and over. Nausea,\nvomiting, and dizziness were reported more frequently in elderlysubjects.\nElderly patients are more likely to have reduced renal function and require\ndose reduction. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or CNS\nadverse events. With respect to CNS adverse events observed during clinical\npractice, somnolence, hallucinations, confusion, and coma were reported more\nfrequently in elderly patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, ADVERSE REACTIONS:\nObserved During Clinical Practice, and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).",

        "value" : "Orally administered erythromycin base and its salts are readily absorbed in the microbiologically active form. Interindividual variations in the absorption of erythromycin are, however, observed, and some patients do not achieve acceptable serum levels. Erythromycin is largely bound to plasma proteins, and the freely dissociating bound fraction after administration of erythromycin base represents 90% of the total erythromycin absorbed. After absorption, erythromycin diffuses readily into most body fluids. In the absence of meningeal inflammation, low concentrations are normally achieved in the spinal fluid, but the passage of the drug across the blood-brain barrier increases in meningitis. The drugis excreted in human milk. The drug crosses the placental barrier, but fetal plasma levels are low. Erythromycin is not removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. In the presence of normal hepatic function erythromycin is concentrated in the liver and is excreted in the bile; the effect of hepatic dysfunction on biliary excretion of erythromycin is not known. After oral administration, less than 5% of the administered dose can be recovered in the active form in the urine. The enteric coating of pellets in ERYC capsules protects the erythromycin base from inactivation by gastric acidity. Because of their small size and enteric coating, the pellets readily pass intact from the stomach to the small intestine and dissolve efficiently to allow absorption of erythromycin in a uniform manner. After administration of a single dose of a 250 mg ERYC capsules, peak serum levels in the range of 1.13 to 1.68 mcg/mL are attained in approximately 3 hours and decline to 0.30-0.42 mcg/mL in 6 hours. Optimal conditions for stability in the presence of gastric secretion and for complete absorption are attained when Erythromycin is taken on an empty stomach. Microbiology: Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis by binding 50 S ribosomal subunits of susceptible organisms. It does not affect nucleic acid synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin and clindamycin, lincomycin, and chloramphenicol. Many strains of Haemophilus influenzae are resistant to erythromycin alone but are susceptible to erythromycin and sulfonamides used concomitantly. Staphylococci resistant to erythromycin may emerge during a course of therapy. Erythromycin has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the  INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. Gram-positive Organisms: Corynebacterium diphtheriae Corynebacterium minutissimum Listeria monocytogenes Staphylococcus aureus (resistant organisms may emerge during treatment.) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Gram-negative Organisms: Bordetella pertussis Haemophilus influenzae Legionella pneumophila Neisseria gonorrhoeae Other Microorganisms: Chlamydia trachomatis Entamoeba histolytica Mycoplasma pneumoniae Treponema pallidum Ureaplasma urealyticum Susceptibility Tests: Dilution techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's). These MIC's provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MIC's should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of erythromycin powder. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDSusceptible\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable. A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDIntermediate\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone which prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDResistant\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard erythromycin powder should provide the following MIC values: Diffusion techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedurerequires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 15-\uFFFD\uFFFDg erythromycin to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to erythromycin. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 15-\uFFFD\uFFFDg erythromycin disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for erythromycin. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 15-\uFFFD\uFFFDg erythromycin disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory test quality control strains:",

ADULTS: The usual dose is 250 mg every 6 hours taken one hour before meals. If twice-a-day dosage is desired, the recommended dose is 500 mg every 12 hours. Dosage may be increased up to 4 grams per day, according to the severity of the infection. Twice-a-day dosing is not recommended when doses larger than 1 gram daily are administered. CHILDREN: Age, weight, and severity of the infection are important factors in determining the proper dosage. The usual dosage is 30 to 50 mg/kg/day in divided doses. For the treatment of more severe infections, this dose may be doubled. Streptococcal infections: A therapeutic dosage of oral erythromycin should be administered for at least 10 days. For continuous prophylaxis against recurrences of streptococcal infections in persons with a history of rheumatic heart disease, the dose is 250 mg twice a day. Primary syphilis: 30-40 grams given in divided doses over a period of 10-15 days.

(See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information). Lower respiratory tract infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes. Listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes. Pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the pro-phylaxis of pertussis in exposed susceptible individuals. Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Skin and skin structure infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus (resistant staphylococci may emerge during treatment). Diphtheria: Infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent establishment of carriers and to eradicate the organism in carriers. Erythrasma: In the treatment of infections due to Corynebacterium minutissimum. Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum: Erythromycin is an alternate choice of treatment for primary syphilis in penicillin-allergic patients. In primary syphilis, spinal fluid examinations should be done before treatment and as part of follow-up after therapy. Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica (oral erythromycins only). Extraenteric amebiasis requires treatment with other agents. Acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae: Erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP followed by erythromycin base orally, as an alternative drug in treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrhoeae in female patients with a history of sensitivity to penicillin. Patients should have a serologic test for syphilis before receiving erythromycin as treatment of gonorrhea and a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months. Erythromycins are indicated for the treatment of the following infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections during pregnancy. When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults due to Chlamydia trachomatis. When tetracyclines are contraindicated or not tolerated, erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of nongono-coccal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum. Legionnaires' Disease caused by Legionella pneumophila. Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, in vitro and limited preliminary clinical data suggest that erythromycin may be effective in treating Legionnaires' Disease. Prophylaxis: Prevention of Initial Attacks of Rheumatic Fever: Penicillin is considered by the American Heart Association to be the drug of choice in the prevention of initial attacks of rheumatic fever (treatment of Streptococcus pyogenes infections of the upper respiratory tract, e.g., tonsillitis or pharyngitis). Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of penicillin-allergic patients.The therapeutic dose should be administered for ten days. Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever: Penicillin or sulfonamides are considered by the American Heart Association to be the drugs of choice in the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever. In patients who are allergic to penicillin and sulfonamides, oral erythromycin is recommended by the American Heart Association in the long-term prophylaxis of streptococcal pharyngitis (for the prevention of recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever). To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ERYC and other antibacterial drugs, ERYC should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

        "value" : "General: Prescribing ERYC in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Since erythromycin is principally excreted by the liver, caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to patients with impaired hepatic function. . There have been reports that erythromycin may aggravate the weakness of patients with myasthenia gravis. Prolonged or repeated use of erythromycin may result in an overgrowth of nonsusceptible bacteria or fungi. If superinfection occurs, erythromycin should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.<br/>Information for patients: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including ERYC should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When ERYC is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by ERYC or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.<br/>Interactions:<br/>Drug interactions: Erythromycin has been reported to significantly alter the metabolism of the nonsedating anti-histamines terfenadine and astemizole when taken concomitantly. Rare cases of serious cardiovascular adverse events, including electrocardiographic QT/QTc interval prolongation, cardiac arrest, torsades de pointes, and other ventricular arrhythmias, have been observed. . In addition, deaths have been reported rarely with concomitant administration of terfenadine and erythromycin. There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions when erythromycin is coadministered with cisapride, resulting in cardiac arrhythmias (QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and torsades de pointes) most likely due to the inhibition of hepatic metabolism of cisapride by erythromycin. There has been an isolated report of drug interaction occurring with the concomitant administration of erythromycin and quinidine in their usual oral forms, resulting in QT prolongation, torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest. Caution and close monitoring is recommended when the drugs are administered concomitantly. Erythromycin use in patients who are receiving high doses of theophylline may be associated with an increase of serum theophylline levels and potential theophylline toxicity. In case of theophylline toxicity and/or elevated serum theophylline levels, the dose of theophylline should be reduced while the patient is receiving concomitant erythromycin therapy. Concomitant administration of erythromycin and digoxin has been reported to result in elevated digoxin serum levels. There have been reports of increased anticoagulant effects when erythromycin and oral anticoagulants were used concomitantly. Increased anticoagulation effects due to this drug may be more pronounced in the elderly. Concurrent use of erythromycin and ergotamine or dihydroergotamine has been associated in some patients with acute ergot toxicity characterized by severe peripheral vasospasm and dysethesia. Erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam and, thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines. The use of erythromycin in patients concurrently taking drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these other drugs. There have been reports of interactions of erythromycin with carbamazepine, cyclosporine, hexobarbital, phenytoin, alfentanil, disopyramide, lovastatin, bromocriptine, valproate, terfenadine and astemizole. Serum concentrations of drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system should be monitored closely in patients concurrently receiving erythromycin.<br/>Drug/laboratory test interactions: Erythromycin interferes with the fluorometric determination of urinary catecholamines.<br/>Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility: Long-term (2-year) oral studies conducted in rats with erythromycin base did not provide evidence of tumorigenicity. Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted. There was no apparent effect on male or female fertility in rats fed erythromycin (base) at levels up to 0.25 percent of diet.<br/>Pregnancy:<br/>Pregnancy Category B:<br/>Teratogenic effects: There was no evidence of teratogenicity or any other adverse effect on reproduction in female rats fed ery-thromycin base (up to 0.25 percent of diet) prior to and during mating, during gestation, and through weaning of two successive litters. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<br/>Labor and delivery: The effect of erythromycin on labor and delivery is unknown.<br/>Nursing mothers: Erythromycin is excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when erythromycin is administered to a nursing woman.<br/>Pediatric use: See INDICATIONS AND USAGE and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.<br/>Geriatric use: Clinical studies with ERYC did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of the decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. See WARNINGS with regard to prolongation of QT syndrome in geriatric patients with erythromycin products. Elderly patients may experience increased effects of oral anticoagulant therapy while undergoing treatment with erythromycin. . ERYC 250 mg capsules do not contain sodium.",

Infants born to women treated during pregnancy with oral erythromycin for early syphilis should be treated with an appropriate penicillin regimen. Rhabdomyolysis with or without renal impairment has been reported in seriously ill patients receiving erythromycin concomitantly with lovastatin. Therefore, patients receiving concomitant lovastatin and erythromycin should be carefully monitored for creatine kinase (CK) and serum transaminase levels. (See package insert for lovastatin.) Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including ERYCCapsules, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.",

        "value" : "Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumis generally well tolerated. The majority of side effects observed in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature and less than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug-related side effects. From the original premarketing studies, where both pediatric and adult patients were enrolled, the most frequently reported adverse effects were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%). The overall incidence of side effects, and in particular diarrhea, increased with the higher recommended dose. Other less frequently reported reactions include: Abdominal discomfort, flatulence, and headache. In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), 1 U.S./Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium45 mg/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided q12h) for 10 days versus amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium40 mg/10 mg/kg/day (divided q8h) for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media. A total of 575 patients were enrolled, and only the suspension formulations were used in this trial. Overall, the adverse event profile seen was comparable to that noted above; however, there were differences in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes. (See CLINICAL STUDIES.) The following adverse reactions have been reported for ampicillin class antibiotics: Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDhairy\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDtongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis. Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS.) Hypersensitivity Reactions: Skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia, and frequently fever), erythema multiforme (rarely Stevens-Johnson syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and an occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported. These reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids. Whenever such reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued, unless the opinion of the physician dictates otherwise. Serious and occasional fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions can occur with oral penicillin. (See WARNINGS.) Liver: A moderate rise in AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) has been noted in patients treated with ampicillin-class antibiotics, but the significance of these findings is unknown. Hepatic dysfunction, including increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been infrequently reported with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment. The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes. The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued. The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible. On rare occasions, deaths have been reported (less than 1 death reported per estimated 4 million prescriptions worldwide). These have generally been cases associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications. Renal: Interstitial nephritis and hematuria have been reported rarely. Crystalluria has also been reported (see OVERDOSAGE). Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with penicillins. These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena. A slight thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients receiving amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumand anticoagulant therapy concomitantly. Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, confusion, convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported rarely. Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration (brown, yellow, or gray staining) has been reported. Most reports occurred in pediatric patients. Discoloration was reduced or eliminated with brushing or dental cleaning in most cases.",

        "value" : "Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.  Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin.  While amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state.  In 1 study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high fat breakfast.  The safety and efficacy of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium have been established in clinical trials where amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was taken without regard to meals. Oral administration of single doses of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumchewable tablets, 400 mg/57 mg and 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension to 28 adult volunteers yielded comparable pharmacokinetic data: Oral administration of 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumoral suspension, 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL or the equivalent dose of 10 mL amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumoral suspension, 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg.hr/mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg.hr/mL for clavulanic acid when 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumoral suspension, 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL or equivalent dose of 10 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium oral suspension, 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL was administered to adult volunteers. One amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumchewable tablet, 250 mg/62.5 mg or 2 amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumchewable tablets, 125 mg/31.25 mg are equivalent to 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumoral suspension, 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL and provide similar serum levels of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumare similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone. The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumis 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1.0 hour. Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding q12h and q8h dosing regimens of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumin adults and children. Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of 10 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumoral suspension, 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL. Concurrent administration of probenecid delays amoxicillin excretion but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid. Neither component in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumis highly protein-bound; clavulanic acid has been found to be approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound. Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid. The results of experiments involving the administration of clavulanic acid to animals suggest that this compound, like amoxicillin, is well distributed in body tissues. Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium oralsuspension to fasting children, average concentrations of 3.0 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions.<br/>Microbiology: Amoxicillin is a semisynthetic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamases, and therefore, the spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactam, structurally related to the penicillins, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins. In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. The formulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumprotects amoxicillin from degradation by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactam antibiotics. Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumpossesses the distinctive properties of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase inhibitor. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE. Gram-Positive Aerobes Staphylococcus aureus (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Gram-Negative Aerobes Enterobacter species (Although most strains of Enterobacter species are resistant in vitro, clinical efficacy has been demonstrated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumin urinary tract infections caused by these organisms.) Escherichia coli (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Haemophilus influenzae (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Klebsiella species (All known strains are\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing.) Moraxella catarrhalis (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 2 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae; MICs of 0.06 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MICs of 4 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of staphylococci and anaerobic bacteria; and MICs of 8 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of other listed organisms. However, with the exception of organisms shown to respond to amoxicillin alone, the safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-Positive Aerobes Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus epidermidis (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Staphylococcus saprophyticus (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes viridans group Streptococcus Gram-Negative Aerobes Eikenella corrodens (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Neisseria gonorrhoeae(\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Proteus mirabilis(\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Anaerobic Bacteria Bacteroides species, including Bacteroides fragilis (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Fusobacterium species (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing) Peptostreptococcus species Susceptibility Testing Dilution Techniques Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial MICs. These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure. Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder. The recommended dilution pattern utilizes a constant amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium ratio of 2 to 1 in all tubes with varying amounts of amoxicillin. MICs are expressed in terms of the amoxicillin concentration in the presence of clavulanic acid at a constant 2 parts amoxicillin to 1 part clavulanic acid. The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR AMOXICILLIN/CLAVULANIC ACID SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING For S. pneumoniae from non-meningitis sources: Isolates should be tested using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and the following criteria should be used: Note: These interpretive criteria are based on the recommended doses for respiratory tract infections. A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDSusceptible\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable. A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDIntermediate\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated. This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used. This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation. A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDResistant\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. Standard amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder should provide the following MIC values: Diffusion Techniques Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds. One such standardized procedurerequires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations. This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: RECOMMENDED RANGES FOR AMOXICILLIN/CLAVULANIC ACID SUSCEPTIBILITY TESTING Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques. Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures. For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory quality control strains:",

Clavulanate elimination is unaltered in this age group. Experience with the 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL formulation in this age group is limited and, thus, use of the 125 mg/31.25 per 5 mL oral suspension is recommended. Pediatric patients weighing 40 kg and more Should be dosed according to the following adult recommendations The usual adult dose is one amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumtablet, 500 mg/125 mg every 12 hours or one amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumtablet, 250 mg/125 mg every 8 hours. For more severe infections and infections of the respiratory tract, the dose should be one amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumtablet, 875 mg/125 mg every 12 hours or one amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium tablet, 500 mg/125 mg every 8 hours. Among adults treated with 875 mg/125 mg tablets every 12 hours, significantly fewer experienced severe diarrhea or withdrawals with diarrhea versus adults treated with 500 mg/125 mg tablets every 8 hours. For detailed adult dosage recommendations, please see complete prescribing information for amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumtablets. Hepatically impaired patients should be dosed with caution and hepatic function monitored at regular intervals. (See WARNINGS.)<br/>Adults: Adults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the 125 mg/5 mL or 250 mg/5 mL suspension in place of the 500 mg tablet. The 200 mg/5 mL suspension or the 400 mg/5 mL suspension may be used in place of the 875 mg tablet. See dosage recommendations above for children weighing 40 kg or more.

The amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg tablet contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid, whereas the 250 mg chewable tablet contains  62.5 mg of clavulanic acid. Therefore, the amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg tablet and the 250 mg chewable tablet should not be substituted for each other, as they are not interchangeable. Due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg tablet (250/125) versus the amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 chewable tablet (250/62.5), the amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg tablet should not be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg and more.<br/>Administration: Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tabletsmay be taken without regard to meals; however, absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablets are administered at the start of a meal.

A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms and do not require gastric emptying. Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin. Crystalluria, in some cases leading to renal failure, has also been reported after amoxicillin overdosage in adult and pediatric patients. In case of overdosage, adequate fluid intake and diuresis should be maintained to reduce the risk of amoxicillin crystalluria. Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration. High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of both amoxicillin and clavulanate. Both amoxicillin and clavulanate are removed from the circulation by hemodialysis.",

        "value" : "General: While amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumpossesses the characteristic low toxicity of the penicillin group of antibiotics, periodic assessment of organ system functions, including renal, hepatic, and hematopoietic function, is advisable during prolonged therapy. A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematous skin rash. Thus, ampicillin-class antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy. If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted. Prescribing amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablets in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.<br/>Information for Patients: Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiummay be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength of the product prescribed. Each dose should be taken with a meal or snack to reduce the possibility of gastrointestinal upset. Many antibiotics can cause diarrhea. If diarrhea is severe or lasts more than 2 or 3 days, call your doctor. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablets, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.<br/>Phenylketonurics: Each amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablet, 200 mg/28.5 mg contains 3.4 mg phenylalanine; each amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablet, 400 mg/57 mg contains 6.7 mg phenylalanine. There are other amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium products that do not contain phenylalanine and can be used by phenylketonurics. Contact your physician or pharmacist.<br/>Drug Interactions: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiummay result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin. Coadministration of probenecid cannot be recommended. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients. There are no data with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumand allopurinol administered concurrently. In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiummay reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.<br/>Drug Laboratory Test Interactions: Oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumwill result in high urine concentrations of amoxicillin. High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST, Benedict's Solution, or Fehling's Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin and therefore amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted. This effect may also occur with amoxicillin and therefore amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.<br/>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.<br/>Mutagenesis: The mutagenic potential of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumwas investigated in vitro with an Ames test, a human lymphocyte cytogenetic assay, a yeast test and a mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, and in vivo with mouse micronucleus tests and a dominant lethal test. All were negative apart from the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay where weak activity was found at very high, cytotoxic concentrations.<br/>Impairment of Fertility: Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumat oral doses of up to 1,200 mg/kg/day (5.7 times the maximum human dose, 1,480 mg/m/day, based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in rats, dosed with a 2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate.<br/>Teratogenic Effects:<br/>Pregnancy (Category B): Reproduction studies performed in pregnant rats and mice given amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumat oral dosages up to 1,200 mg/kg/day, equivalent to 7,200 and 4,080 mg/m/day, respectively (4.9 and 2.8 times the maximum human oral dose based on body surface area), revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.<br/>Labor and Delivery: Oral ampicillin-class antibiotics are generally poorly absorbed during labor. Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions, and duration of contractions. However, it is not known whether the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumin humansduring labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary. In a single study in women with premature rupture of fetal membranes, it was reported that prophylactic treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiummay be associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates.<br/>Nursing Mothers: Ampicillin-class antibiotics are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumis administered to a nursing woman.<br/>Pediatric Use: Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed. Dosing of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumshould be modified in pediatric patients younger than 12 weeks (3 months). (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Pediatric.)",

THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF PENICILLIN HYPERSENSITIVITY WHO HAVE EXPERIENCEDSEVERE REACTIONS WHEN TREATED WITH CEPHALOSPORINS. BEFORE INITIATING THERAPY WITH AMOXICILLIN AND CLAVULANATE POTASSIUM, CAREFUL INQUIRY SHOULD BE MADE CONCERNING PREVIOUS HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTIONS TO PENICILLINS, CEPHALOSPORINS, OR OTHER ALLERGENS.

Pseudomembranous colitis has been reported with nearly all antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, and has ranged in severity from mild to life-threatening. Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.

Studies indicate that a toxin produced by Clostridium difficile is one primary cause of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDantibiotic-associated colitis.\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD After the diagnosis of pseudomembranous colitis has been established, appropriate therapeutic measures should be initiated. Mild cases of pseudomembranous colitis usually respond to drug discontinuation alone. In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation, and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against C. difficile colitis. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumshould be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction. Hepatic toxicity associated with the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumis usually reversible. On rare occasions, deaths have been reported (less than 1 death reported per estimated 4 million prescriptions worldwide). These have generally been cases associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications. (See CONTRAINDICATIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS, Liver.)",

        "value" : "Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant which may be useful\nin the treatment of status epilepticus of the grand mal type. The\nprimary site of action appears to be the motor cortex where spread\nof seizure activity is inhibited. Possibly by promoting sodium efflux\nfrom neurons, phenytoin tends to stabilize the threshold against hyperexcitability\ncaused by excessive stimulation or environmental changes capable of\nreducing membrane sodium gradient. This includes the reduction of\npost-tetanic potentiation at synapses. Loss of post-tetanic potentiation\nprevents cortical seizure foci from detonating adjacent cortical areas.\nPhenytoin reduces the maximal activity of brain stem centers responsible\nfor the tonic phase of grand mal seizures. The\nplasma half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from\n10 to 15 hours. Optimum control without clinical signs of toxicity\noccurs most often with serum levels between 10 mcg/mL and 20\nmcg/mL. A fall in plasma levels may occur when\npatients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The\ndrop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration,\ndue to the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration\nis the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. There are occasions when intramuscular administration\nmay be required, i.e., postoperatively, in comatose patients, for\nGI upsets. During these periods, a sufficient dose must be administered\nintramuscularly to maintain the plasma level within the therapeutic\nrange. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage,\nthe oraldose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow,\ncontinuing IM absorption to avoid toxic symptoms. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience\na drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if\ncrossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However,\nthe intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed,\nas determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin\n(HPPH), the principalmetabolite, as well as the total amount of drug\neventually appearing in the blood.

There is a relatively\nsmall margin between full therapeutic effect and minimally toxic doses\nof this drug. The solution is suitable\nfor use as long as it remains free of haziness and precipitate. Upon\nrefrigeration or freezing, a precipitate might form; this will dissolve\nagain after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature.\nThe product is still suitable for use. Only a clear solution should\nbe used. A faint yellow coloration may develop; however, this has\nno effect on the potency of the solution. In\nthe treatment of status epilepticus, the intravenous route is preferred\nbecause of the delay in absorption of phenytoin when administered\nintramuscularly. Serum concentrations should\nbe monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from\nthe sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin\nsodium injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin.\nBecause there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with\nthe free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments\nand serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a\nproduct formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with\nthe sodium salt and vice versa. Parenteral drug\nproducts should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration\nprior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 mg/kg to 15\nmg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding\n50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a\n70 kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance\ndoses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. Recent work in neonates and children has shown that absorption\nof phenytoin is unreliable after oral administration, but a loading\ndose of 15 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin intravenously will usually\nproduce plasma concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted\ntherapeutic range  (10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected\nslowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 mg/kg/min to 3 mg/kg/min. Parenteral phenytoin should be injected slowly and directly into a large vein\nthrough a large-gauge needle or intravenous catheter. Each injection\nof intravenous phenytoin should be followed by an injection of sterile\nsaline through the same needle or catheter to avoid local venous irritation\ndue to alkalinity of the solution. Continuous infusion should be avoided;\nthe addition of parenteral phenytoin to intravenous infusion fluids\nis not recommended because of the likelihood of precipitation. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood\npressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of\nrespiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin plasma levels is\nadvised when using phenytoin in the management of status epilepticus\nand in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of\nan intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous\nshort-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control\nof seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of\nphenytoin. If administration of parenteral phenytoin\ndoes not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous\nbarbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should\nbe considered. Intramuscular administration\nshould not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because\nthe attainment of peak plasma levels may require up to 24 hours.

When intramuscular administration is required for a patient previously\nstabilized orally, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to\nmaintain therapeutic plasma levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater\nthan the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned\nto oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original\noral dose for one week to prevent excessive plasma levels due to sustained\nrelease from intramuscular tissue sites. If\nthe patient requires more than a week of IM phenytoin, alternative\nroutes should be explored, such as gastric intubation. For time periods\nless than one week, the patient shifted back from IM administration\nshould receive one half the original oral dose for the same period\nof time the patient received IM phenytoin. Monitoring plasma levels\nwould help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood\nlevel determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions\nare suspected.",

        "value" : "General: The addition of phenytoin solution to intravenous\ninfusion is not recommended due to lack of solubility and resultant\nprecipitation. Phenytoin sodium injection should\nbe injected slowly (not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults), directly\ninto a large vein through a large-gauge needle or intravenous catheter.\nEach injection of intravenous phenytoin should be followed by an injection\nof sterile saline through the same needle or intravenous catheter\nto avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution.\nContinuous infusion should be avoided. Soft\ntissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection\nwith and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Soft tissue\nirritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis,\nsloughing and in rare instances has led to amputation. Improper administration\nincluding subcutaneous or perivascular injection should be avoided\nto help prevent possibility of the above. The\nliver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver\nfunction, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show\nearly toxicity. A small percentage of individuals\nwho have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolizethe drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be due to limited enzyme availability\nand lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. Phenytoin should be discontinued if a skin rash appears\n(see WARNINGS section regarding\ndrug discontinuation). If the rash is exfoliative, purpuric, or bullous\nor if lupus erythematosus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal\nnecrolysis is suspected, use of this drug should not be resumed and\nalternative therapy should be considered. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.) If the rash is of a milder type (measles-like\nor scarlatiniform), therapy may be resumed after the rash has completely\ndisappeared. If the rash recurs upon reinstitution of therapy, further\nphenytoin medication is contraindicated. Hyperglycemia,\nresulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release,\nhas been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level\nin diabetic patients. Phenytoin is not indicated\nfor seizures due to hypoglycemic or other metabolic causes. Appropriate\ndiagnostic procedures should be performed as indicated. Phenytoin is not effective for absence (petit mal) seizures.\nIf tonic-clonic (grand mal) and absence (petit mal) seizures are present,\ncombined drug therapy is needed. Serum levels\nof phenytoin sustained above the optimal range may produce confusional\nstates referred to as\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDdelirium\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD,\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDpsychosis\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD,\nor\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDencephalopathy\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD, or rarely irreversible cerebellar\ndysfunction. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, plasma\nlevels are recommended. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated\nif plasma levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is\nrecommended. (See WARNINGS.)<br/>Laboratory Tests: Phenytoin serum level determinations may be necessary\nto achieve optimal dosage adjustments.<br/>Drug Interactions: There are many drugs which may increase or decrease\nphenytoin levels or which phenytoin may affect. The most commonly\noccurring drug interactions are listed below:<br/>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Phenytoin may cause decreased serum levels of protein-bound\niodine (PBI). It may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone\nor metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of\nglucose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).<br/>Carcinogenesis:: See WARNINGS section\nfor information on carcinogenesis.<br/>Pregnancy:: See WARNINGS.<br/>Nursing Mothers:: Infant breast feeding is not recommended for women\ntaking this drug because phenytoin appears to be secreted in low concentrations\nin human milk.",

        "value" : "Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg\nper minute in adults. In neonates, the drug\nshould be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 mg/kg/min to 3 mg/kg/min. Severe cardiotoxic reactions and fatalities have been\nreported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular\nfibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in\nelderly or gravely ill patients. Phenytoin should\nbe used with caution in patients with hypotension and severe myocardial\ninsufficiency. Hypotension usually occurs when\nthe drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The intramuscular route is not recommended for the treatment\nof status epilepticus since blood levels of phenytoin in the therapeutic\nrange cannot be readily achieved with doses and methods of administration\nordinarily employed. There have been a number\nof reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development\nof lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node\nhyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease.\nAlthough a cause and effect relationship has not been established,\nthe occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate\nsuch a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node\ninvolvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling\nserum sickness e.g., fever, rash, and liver involvement. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation\nfor an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made\nto achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. Acute alcoholic intake may increase phenytoin serum levels\nwhile chronic alcoholic use may decrease serum levels.<br/>Usage in Pregnancy: A number of reports suggest an association between\nthe use of antiepileptic drugs by women with epilepsy and a higher\nincidence of birth defects in children born to these women. Data are\nmore extensive with respect to phenytoin and phenobarbital, but these\nare also the most commonly prescribed antiepileptic drugs; less systematic\nor anecdotal reports suggest a possible similar association with the\nuse of all known antiepileptic drugs. The reports\nsuggesting a higher incidence of birth defects in children of drug-treated\nepileptic women cannot be regarded as adequate to prove a definite\ncause and effect relationship. There are intrinsic methodologic problems\nin obtaining adequate data on drug teratogenicity in humans; genetic\nfactors or the epileptic condition itself may be more important than\ndrug therapy in leading to birth defects. The great majority of mothers\non antiepileptic medication deliver normal infants. It is important\nto note that antiepileptic drugs should not be discontinued in patients\nin whom the drug is administered to prevent major seizures, because\nof the strong possibility of precipitating status epilepticus with\nattendant hypoxia and threat to life. In individual cases where the\nseverity and frequency of the seizure disorder are such that the removal\nof medication does not pose a serious threat to the patient, discontinuation\nof the drug may be considered prior to and during pregnancy, although\nit cannot be said with any confidence that even minor seizures do\nnot pose some hazard to the developing embryo or fetus. The prescribing\nphysician will wish to weigh these considerations in treating or counseling\nepileptic women of childbearing potential. In\naddition to the reports of increased incidence of congenital malformation,\nsuch as cleft lip/palate and heart malformations in children of women\nreceiving phenytoin and other antiepileptic drugs, there have more\nrecently been reports of a fetal hydantoin syndrome. This consists\nof prenatal growth deficiency, microcephaly and mental deficiency\nin children born tomothers who have received phenytoin, barbiturates,\nalcohol, or trimethadione. However, these features are all interrelated\nand are frequently associated with intrauterine growth retardation\nfrom other causes. There have been isolated\nreports of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose\nmothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. An increase in seizure frequency during pregnancy occurs in a high\nproportion of patients, because of altered phenytoin absorption or\nmetabolism. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin levels is particularly\nvaluable in the management of a pregnant epileptic patient as a guide\nto an appropriate adjustment of dosage. However, postpartum restoration\nof the original dosage will probably be indicated. Neonatal coagulation defects have been reported within the first\n24 hours in babies born to epileptic mothers receiving phenobarbital\nand/or phenytoin. Vitamin K has been shown to prevent or correct this\ndefect and has been recommended to be given to the mother before delivery\nand the neonate after birth.",

        "value" : "Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is generally well tolerated.  The majority of side effects observed in clinical trials were of a mild and transient nature and less than 3% of patients discontinued therapy because of drug-related side effects.  From the original premarketing studies, where both pediatric and adult patients were enrolled, the most frequently reported adverse effects were diarrhea/loose stools (9%), nausea (3%), skin rashes and urticaria (3%), vomiting (1%) and vaginitis (1%).  The overall incidence of side effects, and in particular diarrhea, increased with the higher recommended dose.  Other less frequently reported reactions include: abdominal discomfort, flatulence and headache. In pediatric patients (aged 2 months to 12 years), one U.S./Canadian clinical trial was conducted which compared amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 45 mg/6.4 mg/kg/day (divided q12h) for 10 days versus amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 40 mg10 mg/kg/day (divided q8h) for 10 days in the treatment of acute otitis media.  A total of 575 patients were enrolled and only the suspension formulations were used in this trial.  Overall, the adverse event profile seen was comparable to that noted above.  However, there were differences in the rates of diarrhea, skin rashes/urticaria, and diaper area rashes.  (See CLINICAL STUDIES.) The following adverse reactions have been reported for ampicillin class antibiotics:<br/>Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, indigestion, gastritis, stomatitis, glossitis, black\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDhairy\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDtongue, mucocutaneous candidiasis, enterocolitis, and hemorrhagic/pseudomembranous colitis.  Onset of pseudomembranous colitis symptoms may occur during or after antibiotic treatment. (See WARNINGS.)<br/>Hypersensitivity Reactions: Skin rashes, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, serum sickness-like reactions (urticaria or skin rash accompanied by arthritis, arthralgia, myalgia and frequently fever), erythema multiforme (rarely Stevens-Johnson Syndrome), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis and an occasional case of exfoliative dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported.  These reactions may be controlled with antihistamines and, if necessary, systemic corticosteroids.  Whenever such reactions occur, the drug should be discontinued, unless the opinion of the physician dictates otherwise.  Serious and occasional fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions can occur with oral penicillin. (See WARNINGS.)<br/>Liver: A moderate rise in AST (SGOT) and/or ALT (SGPT) has been noted in patients treated with ampicillin class antibiotics but the significance of these findings is unknown.  Hepatic dysfunction, including increases in serum transaminases (AST and/or ALT), serum bilirubin and/or alkaline phosphatase, has been infrequently reported with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.  It has been reported more commonly in the elderly, in males, or in patients on prolonged treatment.  The histologic findings on liver biopsy have consisted of predominantly cholestatic, hepatocellular, or mixed cholestatic-hepatocellular changes.  The onset of signs/symptoms of hepatic dysfunction may occur during or several weeks after therapy has been discontinued.  The hepatic dysfunction, which may be severe, is usually reversible.  On rare occasions, deaths have been reported (less than 1 death reported per estimated 4 million prescriptions worldwide).  These have generally been cases associated with serious underlying diseases or concomitant medications.<br/>Renal: Interstitial nephritis and hematuria have been reported rarely.<br/>Hemic and Lymphatic Systems: Anemia, including hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenic purpura, eosinophilia, leukopenia and agranulocytosis have been reported during therapy with penicillins.  These reactions are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy and are believed to be hypersensitivity phenomena.  A slight thrombocytosis was noted in less than 1% of the patients treated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.  There have been reports of increased prothrombin time in patients receiving amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium and anticoagulant therapy concomitantly.<br/>Central Nervous System: Agitation, anxiety, behavioral changes, confusion, convulsions, dizziness, insomnia, and reversible hyperactivity have been reported rarely.<br/>Miscellaneous: Tooth discoloration has been reported very rarely in children.

        "value" : "Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.  Dosing in the fasted or fed state has minimal effect on the pharmacokinetics of amoxicillin.  While amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium can be given without regard to meals, absorption of clavulanate potassium when taken with food is greater relative to the fasted state.  In one study, the relative bioavailability of clavulanate was reduced when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was dosed at 30 and 150 minutes after the start of a high fat breakfast.  The safety and efficacy of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium have been established in clinical trials where amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was taken without regard to meals. Oral administration of single doses of 400 mg amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium chewable tablets and 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension to 28 adult volunteers yielded comparable pharmacokinetic data: Oral administration of 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension or the equivalent dose of 10 mL amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL suspension provides average peak serum concentrations approximately 1 hour after dosing of 6.9 mcg/mL for amoxicillin and 1.6 mcg/mL for clavulanic acid. The areas under the serum concentration curves obtained during the first 4 hours after dosing were 12.6 mcg.hr./mL for amoxicillin and 2.9 mcg.hr./mL forclavulanic acid when 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension or equivalent dose of 10 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL suspension was administered to adult volunteers. One amoxicillin 250 mg and clavulanate potassium chewable tablet or 2 amoxicillin 125 mg and clavulanate potassium chewable tablets are equivalent to 5 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension and provide similar serum levels ofamoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin serum concentrations achieved with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium are similar to those produced by the oral administration of equivalent doses of amoxicillin alone.  The half-life of amoxicillin after the oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is 1.3 hours and that of clavulanic acid is 1.0 hour.  Time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of 1.0 mcg/mL for amoxicillin has been shown to be similar after corresponding q12h and q8h dosing regimens of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in adults and children. Approximately 50% to 70% of the amoxicillin and approximately 25% to 40% of the clavulanic acid are excreted unchanged in urine during the first 6 hours after administration of 10 mL of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension. Concurrent administration of probenecid delays amoxicillin excretion but does not delay renal excretion of clavulanic acid. Neither component in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension is highly protein-bound; clavulanic acid has been found to be approximately 25% bound to human serum and amoxicillin approximately 18% bound. Amoxicillin diffuses readily into most body tissues and fluids with the exception of the brain and spinal fluid.  The results of experiments involving the administration of clavulanic acid to animals suggest that this compound, like amoxicillin, is well distributed in body tissues. Two hours after oral administration of a single 35 mg/kg dose of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumsuspension to fasting children, average concentrations of 3.0 mcg/mL of amoxicillin and 0.5 mcg/mL of clavulanic acid were detected in middle ear effusions. Microbiology:  Amoxicillin is a semisynthethic antibiotic with a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms. Amoxicillin is, however, susceptible to degradation by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamases and, therefore, the spectrum of activity does not include organisms which produce these enzymes.  Clavulanic acid is a\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactam, structurally related to the penicillins, which possesses the ability to inactivate a wide range of\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase enzymes commonly found in microorganisms resistant to penicillins and cephalosporins.  In particular, it has good activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. The formulation of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium protects amoxicillin from degradation by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase enzymes and effectively extends the antibiotic spectrum of amoxicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to amoxicillin and other\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactam antibiotics.  Thus, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium possesses the distinctive properties of a broad-spectrum antibiotic and a\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase inhibitor. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.<br/>Gram-Positive Aerobes: Staphylococcus aureus (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing)<br/>Gram-Negative Aerobes: Enterobacter species (Although most strains of Enterobacter species are resistant in vitro, clinical efficacy has been demonstrated with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in urinary tract infections caused by these organisms.) Escherichia coli (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Haemophilus influenzae (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Klebsiella species (All known strains are\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Moraxella catarrhalis (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of Streptococcus pneumoniaeMICs of 0.06 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae; MICs of 4 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of staphylococci and anaerobic bacteria; and MICs of 8 mcg/mL or less against most (\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFD90%) strains of other listed organisms.  However, with the exception of organisms shown to respond to amoxicillin alone, the safety and effectiveness of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.<br/>Gram-Positive Aerobes: Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus epidermidis (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Staphylococcus saprophyticus (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes viridans group Streptococcus<br/>Gram-Negative Aerobes: Eikenella corrodens (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Neisseria gonorrhoeae(\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Proteus mirabilis(\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing)<br/>Anaerobic Bacteria: Bacteroides species, including Bacteroides fragilis (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Fusobacterium species (\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase and non-\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase producing) Peptostreptococcus species<br/>Susceptibility Testing:<br/>Dilution Techniques: Quantitative methods are used to determine antimicrobial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs).  These MICs provide estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.  The MICs should be determined using a standardized procedure.  Standardized procedures are based on a dilution method(broth or agar) or equivalent with standardized inoculum concentrations and standardized concentrations of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder. The recommended dilution pattern utilizes a constant amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium ratio of 2 to 1 in all tubes with varying amounts of amoxicillin.  MICs are expressed in terms of the amoxicillin concentration in the presence of clavulanic acid at a constant 2 parts amoxicillin to 1 part clavulanic acid.  The MIC values should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Recommended Ranges for Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid Susceptibility Testing: For gram-negative enteric aerobes: For StaphylococcusandHaemophilus species: For Streptococcus pneumoniae:  Isolates should be tested using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and the following criteria should be used: A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDSusceptible\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentration usually achievable.  A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDIntermediate\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the result should be considered equivocal, and, if the microorganism is not fully susceptible to alternative, clinically feasible drugs, the test should be repeated.  This category implies possible clinical applicability in body sites where the drug is physiologically concentrated or in situations where high dosage of drug can be used.  This category also provides a buffer zone that prevents small uncontrolled technical factors from causing major discrepancies in interpretation.  A report of\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDResistant\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDindicates that the pathogen is not likely to be inhibited if the antimicrobial compound in the blood reaches the concentrations usually achievable; other therapy should be selected. Standardized susceptibility test procedures require the use of laboratory control microorganisms to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures.  Standard amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium powder should provide the following MIC values:<br/>Diffusion Techniques: Quantitative methods that require measurement of zone diameters also provide reproducible estimates of the susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial compounds.  One such standardized procedurerequires the use of standardized inoculum concentrations.  This procedure uses paper disks impregnated with 30 mcg of amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) to test the susceptibility of microorganisms to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Reports from the laboratory providing results of the standard single-disk susceptibility test with a 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) disk should be interpreted according to the following criteria: Recommended Ranges for Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid Susceptibility Testing For Staphylococcusspecies and H. influenzae: For other organisms except S. pneumoniaeand N. gonorrhoeae: Interpretation should be as stated above for results using dilution techniques.  Interpretation involves correlation of the diameter obtained in the disk test with the MIC for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. As with standardized dilution techniques, diffusion methods require the use of laboratory control microorganisms that are used to control the technical aspects of the laboratory procedures.  For the diffusion technique, the 30 mcg amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium (20 mcg amoxicillin plus 10 mcg clavulanate potassium) disk should provide the following zone diameters in these laboratory quality control strains:",

Chemically, amoxicillin is (2S,5R,6R)-6-[(R)-(-)-2-amino-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)acetamido]-3,3-dimethyl-7-oxo-4-thia-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]heptane-2- carboxylic acid trihydrate and has the following structural formula: CHNOS\uFFFD\uFFFD3HO\tM.W.  419.46 Clavulanic acid is produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces clavuligerus.  It is a\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactam structurally related to the penicillins and possesses the ability to inactivate a wide variety of\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamases by blocking the active sites of these enzymes.  Clavulanic acid is particularly active against the clinically important plasmid mediated\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamases frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins.  Chemically clavulanate potassium is potassium (Z)-(2R,5R)-3-(2-hydroxyethylidene)-7-oxo-4-oxa-1-azabicyclo[3.2.0]-heptane-2-carboxylate and has the following structural formula: CHKNOM.W. 237.25 After reconstitution each teaspoonful (5 mL) of suspension will contain 200 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate and 28.5 mg clavulanic acid as the potassium salt or 400 mg amoxicillin as the trihydrate and 57 mg clavulanic acid as the potassium salt.  Each 5 mL of reconstituted amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP, 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL contains 0.14 mEq potassium.  Each 5 mL of reconstituted amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP, 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL contains 0.29 mEq of potassium.<br/>Inactive Ingredients: Powder for oral suspension - artificial raspberry powder, aspartame*, citric acid, colloidal silicon dioxide, mannitol, hypromellose, natural orange flavor, sodium citrate, sodium saccharin and xanthan gum.",

        "value" : "Dosage:<br/>Pediatric Patients: Based on the amoxicillin component, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension should be dosed as follows:<br/>Adults: Adults who have difficulty swallowing may be given the 125 mg/31.25 mg per 5 mL or 250 mg/62.5 mg per 5 mL suspension in place of the 500 mg tablet.  The 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL suspension or the 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL suspension may be used in place of the 875 mg tablet.  See dosage recommendations above for children weighing 40 kg or more. The amoxicillin 250 mg and clavulanate potassium tablet and the 250 mg chewable tablet do not contain the same amount of clavulanic acid (as the potassium salt). The amoxicillin 250 mg and clavulanate potassium tablet contains 125 mg of clavulanic acid, whereas the 250 mg chewable tablet contains 62.5 mg of clavulanic acid. Therefore, the amoxicillin 250 mg and clavulanate potassium tablet and the 250 mg chewable tablet should not be substituted for each other, as they are not interchangeable. Due to the different amoxicillin to clavulanic acid ratios in the amoxicillin 250 mg and clavulanate potassium tablet (250 mg/125 mg) versus the amoxicillin 250 mg and clavulanate potassium chewable tablet (250 mg/62.5 mg), the amoxicillin 250 mg and clavulanate potassium tablet should not be used until the child weighs at least 40 kg and more.<br/>Directions for Mixing Oral Suspension: Prepare a suspension at time of dispensing as follows:  Tap bottle until all the powder flows freely.  Add approximately 2/3 of the total amount of water for reconstitution (see table below) and shake vigorously to suspend powder.  Add remainder of the water and again shake vigorously. Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 200 mg amoxicillin and 28.5 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt. Each teaspoonful (5 mL) will contain 400 mg amoxicillin and 57 mg of clavulanic acid as the potassium salt. Note: SHAKE ORAL SUSPENSION WELL BEFORE USING. Reconstituted suspension must be stored under refrigeration and discarded after 10 days.<br/>Administration: Reconstituted amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension may be taken without regard to meals; however, absorption of clavulanate potassium is enhanced when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension is administered at the start of a meal.  To minimize the potential for gastrointestinal intolerance, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension should be taken at the start of a meal.",

        "value" : "To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP and other antibacterial drugs, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below: Lower Respiratory Tract Infections\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDcaused by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Otitis Media\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDcaused by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Sinusitis\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDcaused by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis. Skin and Skin Structure Infections\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDcaused by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. Urinary Tract Infections\uFFFD\uFFFD\uFFFDcaused by\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp. While amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium treatment due to its amoxicillin content.  Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing organisms susceptible to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should not require the addition of another antibiotic.  Because amoxicillin has greater in vitro activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae than does ampicillin or penicillin, the majority of S. pneumoniae strains with intermediate susceptibility to ampicillin or penicillin are fully susceptible to amoxicillin and amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium. (See Microbiology subsection.) Bacteriological studies, to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, should be performed together with any indicated surgical procedures. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the\uFFFD\uFFFD-lactamase-producing organisms listed above.  Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted, if appropriate.",

If the overdosage is very recent and there is no contraindication, an attempt at emesis or other means of removal of drug from the stomach may be performed.  A prospective study of 51 pediatric patients at a poison center suggested that overdosages of less than 250 mg/kg of amoxicillin are not associated with significant clinical symptoms and do not require gastric emptying. Interstitial nephritis resulting in oliguric renal failure has been reported in a small number of patients after overdosage with amoxicillin.  Renal impairment appears to be reversible with cessation of drug administration.  High blood levels may occur more readily in patients with impaired renal function because of decreased renal clearance of both amoxicillin and clavulanate.

    "http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/dailymed/resource/dailymed/precaution" : [ {
        "value" : "General: Prescribing amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. While amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium possesses the characteristic low toxicity of the penicillin group of antibiotics, periodic assessment of organ system functions, including renal, hepatic and hematopoietic function, is advisable during prolonged therapy. A high percentage of patients with mononucleosis who receive ampicillin develop an erythematous skin rash.  Thus, ampicillin class antibiotics should not be administered to patients with mononucleosis. The possibility of superinfections with mycotic or bacterial pathogens should be kept in mind during therapy.  If superinfections occur (usually involving Pseudomonas or Candida), the drug should be discontinued and/or appropriate therapy instituted.<br/>Information for the Patient: Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium for oral suspension USP or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may be taken every 8 hours or every 12 hours, depending on the strength of the product prescribed.  Each dose should be taken with a meal or snack to reduce the possibility of gastrointestinal upset.  Many antibiotics can cause diarrhea.  If diarrhea is severe or lasts more than 2 or 3 days, call your doctor. Make sure your child completes the entire prescribed course of treatment, even if he/she begins to feel better after a few days.  Keep suspension refrigerated.  Shake well before using.  When dosing a child with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium suspension (liquid), use a dosing spoon or medicine dropper.  Be sure to rinse the spoon or dropper after each use.  Bottles of amoxicillin and clavulanatepotassium suspension may contain more liquid than required.  Follow your doctor's instructions about the amount to use and the days of treatment your child requires.  Discard any unused medicine.<br/>Phenylketonurics: Each 5 mL of the 200 mg/28.5 mg per 5 mL oral suspension contains 0.67 mg phenylalanine.  Each 5 mL of the 400 mg/57 mg per 5 mL oral suspension contains 1.12 mg phenylalanine.  Contact your physician or pharmacist.<br/>Drug Interactions: Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin.  Concurrent use with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.  Co-administration of probenecid cannot be recommended. The concurrent administration of allopurinol and ampicillin increases substantially the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving ampicillin alone.  It is not known whether this potentiation of ampicillin rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.  There are no data with amoxicillinand clavulanate potassium and allopurinol administered concurrently. In common with other broad-spectrum antibiotics, amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives.<br/>Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions: Oral administration of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium will result in high urine concentrations of amoxicillin.  High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using Clinitest, Benedict's Solution or Fehling's Solution.  Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin and therefore amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as Clinistix) be used. Following administration of ampicillin to pregnant women a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone and estradiol has been noted.  This effect may also occur with amoxicillin and therefore amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.<br/>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential.<br/>Mutagenesis: The mutagenic potential of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium was investigated in vitro with an Ames test, a human lymphocyte cytogenetic assay, a yeast test and a mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, and in vivo with mouse micronucleus tests and a dominant lethal test.  All were negative apart from the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay where weak activity was found at very high, cytotoxic concentrations.<br/>Impairment of Fertility: Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium at oral doses of up to 1200 mg/kg/day (5.7 times the maximum human dose, 1480 mg/m/day, based on body surface area) was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance in rats, dosed with a 2:1 ratio formulation of amoxicillin:clavulanate.<br/>Teratogenic Effects:<br/>Labor and Delivery: Oral ampicillin class antibiotics are generally poorly absorbed during labor.  Studies in guinea pigs have shown that intravenous administration of ampicillin decreased the uterine tone, frequency of contractions, height of contractions and duration of contractions.  However, it is not known whether the use of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in humans during labor or delivery has immediate or delayed adverse effects on the fetus, prolongs the duration of labor, or increases the likelihood that forceps delivery or other obstetrical intervention or resuscitation of the newborn will be necessary.  In a single study in women with premature rupture of fetal membranes, it was reported that prophylactic treatment withamoxicillin and clavulanate potassium may be associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates.<br/>Nursing Mothers: Ampicillin class antibiotics are excreted in the milk; therefore, caution should be exercised when amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is administered to a nursing woman.<br/>Pediatric Use: Because of incompletely developed renal function in neonates and young infants, the elimination of amoxicillin may be delayed.  Dosing of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium should be modified in pediatric patients younger than 12 weeks (3 months).  (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Pediatric.)",

Therefore, it is important to consider this diagnosis in patients who present with diarrhea subsequent to the administration of antibacterial agents.

In moderate to severe cases, consideration should be given to management with fluids and electrolytes, protein supplementation and treatment with an antibacterial drug clinically effective against Clostridium difficile colitis. Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassiumshould be used with caution in patients with evidence of hepatic dysfunction.  Hepatic toxicity associated with the use ofamoxicillin and clavulanate potassium is usually reversible.
